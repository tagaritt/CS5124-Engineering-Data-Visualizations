1,1,Pilot,1,Michael,All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?,
1,1,Pilot,1,Jim,"Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...",
1,1,Pilot,1,Michael,"So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?",
1,1,Pilot,1,Jim,"Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.",
1,1,Pilot,1,Michael,"All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.",
1,1,Pilot,2,Michael," Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger.  All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake.  That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so...  So that's the way it's done.",
1,1,Pilot,3,Michael,"I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?",
1,1,Pilot,3,Pam,Well. I don't know.,
1,1,Pilot,3,Michael,"If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. ",
1,1,Pilot,3,Pam,What?,
1,1,Pilot,3,Michael,Any messages?,
1,1,Pilot,3,Pam,"Uh, yeah. Just a fax.",
1,1,Pilot,3,Michael,"Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.",
1,1,Pilot,3,Pam,You haven't told me.,
1,1,Pilot,3,Michael,It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.,
1,1,Pilot,4,Michael,"People say I am the best boss. They go, ""God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious."" ""And you get the best out of us.""  I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.",
1,1,Pilot,5,Dwight, Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum  I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum ,
1,1,Pilot,6,Jim,"My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.",
1,1,Pilot,7,Michael,Whassup!,
1,1,Pilot,7,Jim,Whassup! I still love that after seven years.,
1,1,Pilot,7,Michael,Whassup!,
1,1,Pilot,7,Dwight,Whassup!,
1,1,Pilot,7,Michael,Whass...up!,
1,1,Pilot,7,Dwight,Whassup.,
1,1,Pilot,7,Michael, What?,
1,1,Pilot,7,Jim,Nothing.,
1,1,Pilot,7,Michael,OK. All right. See you later.,
1,1,Pilot,7,Jim,All right. Take care.,
1,1,Pilot,7,Michael,Back to work.,
1,1,Pilot,8,Jan, Just before lunch. That would be great.,
1,1,Pilot,9,Michael,"Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould.  Jan, hello. I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.",
1,1,Pilot,10,Jan,"Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?",
1,1,Pilot,10,Michael,Um... Me no get an agenda.,
1,1,Pilot,10,Jan,What? I'm sorry?,
1,1,Pilot,10,Michael,I didn't get any agenda.,
1,1,Pilot,10,Jan,"Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.",
1,1,Pilot,10,Michael,Really? I didn't...  Did we get a fax this morning?,
1,1,Pilot,10,Pam,"Uh, yeah, the one...",
1,1,Pilot,10,Michael,"Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?",
1,1,Pilot,10,Pam,You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.,
1,1,Pilot,10,Michael,"Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.",
1,1,Pilot,10,Jan,Do you want to look at mine?,
1,1,Pilot,10,Michael,"Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.",
1,1,Pilot,10,Jan,"OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.",
1,1,Pilot,10,Michael,OK...,
1,1,Pilot,10,Jan,"Michael, don't panic.",
1,1,Pilot,10,Michael,"No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.",
1,1,Pilot,10,Jan,"No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made... We haven't decided.",
1,1,Pilot,10,Michael,All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!,
1,1,Pilot,10,Jan,I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.,
1,1,Pilot,10,Michael,OK. No problem.,
1,1,Pilot,10,Jan,"This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.",
1,1,Pilot,10,Michael,"Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?",
1,1,Pilot,11,Michael,"Question. How long do we have to...  Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?",
1,1,Pilot,11,Jan,Go ahead.,
1,1,Pilot,11,Michel,Packman.,
1,1,Pilot,11,Todd Packer,"Hey, you big queen.",
1,1,Pilot,11,Michael,"Oh, that's not appropriate.",
1,1,Pilot,11,Todd Packer,"Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?",
1,1,Pilot,11,Michael,"Uh, I don't know what you mean.",
1,1,Pilot,11,Todd Packer,I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?,
1,1,Pilot,11,Michael,"Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.",
1,1,Pilot,11,Jan,So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.,
1,1,Pilot,11,Michael,"No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.  Like that.",
1,1,Pilot,12,Phyllis,So what does downsizing actually mean?,
1,1,Pilot,12,Stanley,Well...,
1,1,Pilot,13,Oscar,You guys better update your resumes just like I'm doing.,
1,1,Pilot,14,Angela,I bet it's gonna be me. Probably gonna be me.,
1,1,Pilot,14,Kevin,"Yeah, it'll be you.",
1,1,Pilot,15,Pam,I have an important question for you.,
1,1,Pilot,15,Jim,Yes?,
1,1,Pilot,15,Pam,Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?,
1,1,Pilot,15,Jim,"Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.",
1,1,Pilot,16,Michael,"Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.",
1,1,Pilot,17,Michael,Hey.,
1,1,Pilot,17,Ryan,Hey.,
1,1,Pilot,17,Pam,This is Mr. Scott.,
1,1,Pilot,17,Michael,Guilty! Guilty as charged!,
1,1,Pilot,17,Ryan,Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.,
1,1,Pilot,17,Michael,"Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.",
1,1,Pilot,17,Ryan,Yup.,
1,1,Pilot,17,Michael,"Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee!  Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go.  I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. ",
1,1,Pilot,18,Pam,"I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.",
1,1,Pilot,18,Pam,Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.,
1,1,Pilot,19,Jim,"Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?",
1,1,Pilot,19,Dwight,What?,
1,1,Pilot,19,Jim,What are you doing?,
1,1,Pilot,19,Dwight,Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.,
1,1,Pilot,19,Jim,It's not on your desk.,
1,1,Pilot,19,Dwight,"It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.",
1,1,Pilot,19,Dwight,You can't do that.,
1,1,Pilot,19,Jim,Why not?,
1,1,Pilot,19,Dwight,Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.,
1,1,Pilot,19,Jim, We'll see.  This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.,
1,1,Pilot,19,Dwight,Downsizing?,
1,1,Pilot,20,Dwight,"Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.",
1,1,Pilot,21,Pam,You just still have these messages from yesterday.,
1,1,Pilot,21,Michael,"Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. ",
1,1,Pilot,21,Pam,What?,
1,1,Pilot,21,Michael,"Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.",
1,1,Pilot,21,Pam,Don't we all?,
1,1,Pilot,21,Michael,I'm sorry?,
1,1,Pilot,21,Pam,Nothing.,
1,1,Pilot,21,Michael,"If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. ",
1,1,Pilot,22,Michael,"I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect.  Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.",
1,1,Pilot,23,Michael,"People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.",
1,1,Pilot,24,Michael,Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.,
1,1,Pilot,24,Dwight,I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.,
1,1,Pilot,24,Michael,Assistant to the Regional Manager.,
1,1,Pilot,24,Dwight,"OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?",
1,1,Pilot,24,Michael,I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.,
1,1,Pilot,24,Oscar,Can't you just tell us.,
1,1,Pilot,24,Dwight,"Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?",
1,1,Pilot,24,Michael,You don't know what it is. ,
1,1,Pilot,24,Dwight,OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.,
1,1,Pilot,24,Michael,I don't need your permission.,
1,1,Pilot,24,Dwight,Go ahead.,
1,1,Pilot,24,Michael,Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.,
1,1,Pilot,25,Ryan,I heard they might be closing this branch down. That's just the rumor going around. This is my first day. I don't really know.,
1,1,Pilot,26,Oscar,"Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?",
1,1,Pilot,26,Michael,Not gonna happen.,
1,1,Pilot,26,Stanley,It could be out of your hands Michael.,
1,1,Pilot,26,Michael,"It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.",
1,1,Pilot,26,Stanley,Can you promise that?,
1,1,Pilot,26,Dwight,On his mother's grave.,
1,1,Pilot,26,Michael,No.,
1,1,Pilot,26,Phyllis,What?,
1,1,Pilot,26,Michael,"Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.",
1,1,Pilot,26,Stanley,It's just that we need to know.,
1,1,Pilot,26,Michael,"I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.",
1,1,Pilot,26,Pam,I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.,
1,1,Pilot,26,Man,Are you sure about that?,
1,1,Pilot,26,Michael,"Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.",
1,1,Pilot,26,Dwight,"Pam, information is power.",
1,1,Pilot,26,Stanley,"You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?",
1,1,Pilot,26,Michael,"No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.",
1,1,Pilot,27,Jim,"If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.",
1,1,Pilot,28,Pam,"Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... ",
1,1,Pilot,29,Michael,"Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.",
1,1,Pilot,29,Ryan,What's up? Nice to meet you.,
1,1,Pilot,29,Michael,Introduce yourself. Be polite.,
1,1,Pilot,29,Dwight,"Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.",
1,1,Pilot,29,Michael,"Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.",
1,1,Pilot,29,Dwight,"Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.",
1,1,Pilot,29,Michael,That's his profit.,
1,1,Pilot,29,Dwight,"New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.",
1,1,Pilot,30,Dwight,Damn it! Jim!,
1,1,Pilot,30,Michael,"OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?",
1,1,Pilot,30,Dwight,He put my stuff in Jell-O again.,
1,1,Pilot,30,Dwight,That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.,
1,1,Pilot,31,Dwight,"It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.",
1,1,Pilot,32,Michael,What is that?,
1,1,Pilot,32,Dwight,That is my stapler.,
1,1,Pilot,32,Michael,"No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.",
1,1,Pilot,32,Dwight,"OK you know what, you can be a witness.  Can you reprimand him?",
1,1,Pilot,32,Jim,How do you know it was me?,
1,1,Pilot,32,Dwight,It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?,
1,1,Pilot,32,Michael,"Discipline. Kinky!  All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.",
1,1,Pilot,32,Dwight,Yeah.,
1,1,Pilot,32,Michael,"And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.",
1,1,Pilot,32,Jim,"OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.",
1,1,Pilot,32,Michael, Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.,
1,1,Pilot,32,Ryan,You should've put him in custardy.,
1,1,Pilot,32,Michael,Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.,
1,1,Pilot,32,Dwight,"OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.",
1,1,Pilot,32,Michael,Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.,
1,1,Pilot,33,Jim,Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?,
1,1,Pilot,33,Pam,Yeah.,
1,1,Pilot,33,Jim,That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.,
1,1,Pilot,33,Pam,So when are we going out?,
1,1,Pilot,33,Jim,"Tonight, hopefully.",
1,1,Pilot,33,Pam,OK. Yeah.,
1,1,Pilot,33,Roy,"Hey, man.",
1,1,Pilot,33,Jim,What's going on?,
1,1,Pilot,33,Roy,"Hey, baby.",
1,1,Pilot,33,Pam,Hey.,
1,1,Pilot,34,Pam,Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.,
1,1,Pilot,35,Pam,Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?,
1,1,Pilot,35,Roy,"No, no. Come on. Let's get out of here and go home.",
1,1,Pilot,35,Pam,OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.,
1,1,Pilot,35,Jim,You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.,
1,1,Pilot,35,Roy,"It sounds good. Seriously, we've gotta get going.",
1,1,Pilot,35,Jim,"Yeah, yeah.",
1,1,Pilot,35,Jim,Um... What's in the bag?,
1,1,Pilot,35,Roy,Just tell her I'll talk to her later.,
1,1,Pilot,35,Jim,"No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.",
1,1,Pilot,36,Jim,Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? ,
1,1,Pilot,37,Michael,"So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third.  Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?",
1,1,Pilot,37,Ryan,Yeah.,
1,1,Pilot,37,Michael,"You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?",
1,1,Pilot,37,Ryan,All right.,
1,1,Pilot,37,Michael,"Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...",
1,1,Pilot,37,Pam,You got a fax.,
1,1,Pilot,37,Michael,"Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.",
1,1,Pilot,37,Pam,What? Why?,
1,1,Pilot,37,Michael,"Why? Well, theft and stealing.",
1,1,Pilot,37,Pam,Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?,
1,1,Pilot,37,Michael,Post-it Notes.,
1,1,Pilot,37,Pam,"Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?",
1,1,Pilot,37,Michael,"50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.",
1,1,Pilot,37,Pam,Are you serious?,
1,1,Pilot,37,Michael,Yeah. I am.,
1,1,Pilot,37,Pam,I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.,
1,1,Pilot,37,Michael,But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.,
1,1,Pilot,37,Michael," You been X'd punk!  Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.",
1,1,Pilot,37,Pam,You're a jerk.,
1,1,Pilot,37,Michael,I don't know about that.,
1,1,Pilot,38,Michael,"What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, ""Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?"" Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.",
1,1,Pilot,39,Pam,Hey.,
1,1,Pilot,39,Jim,Hey.,
1,1,Pilot,39,Jim,How are things?,
1,1,Pilot,39,Pam,Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...,
1,1,Pilot,39,Jim,"Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?",
1,1,Pilot,39,Pam,"It's better, thanks.",
1,1,Pilot,39,Jim,Good. Good.,
1,1,Pilot,39,Pam,Yeah.,
1,1,Pilot,39,Jim,That's great,
1,1,Pilot,39,Pam,Is...?,
1,1,Pilot,39,Jim,Yeah?,
1,1,Pilot,39,Pam,Um... Are you...,
1,1,Pilot,39,Jim,Am I walking out?,
1,1,Pilot,39,Pam,Yes.,
1,1,Pilot,39,Jim,"Yes, I... Do you want to...",
1,1,Pilot,39,Pam,Yeah.,
1,1,Pilot,39,Jim,Great. Let me just...,
1,1,Pilot,39,Jim," Oh, Roy.",
1,1,Pilot,39,Pam,"Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.",
1,1,Pilot,39,Jim,"Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it.  You know what, just come here.",
1,2,Diversity Day,40,Michael,"Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?",
1,2,Diversity Day,40,Mr. Brown,"Oh, I'm all set, thanks.",
1,2,Diversity Day,40,Michael,Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.,
1,2,Diversity Day,41,Michael,"Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited.",
1,2,Diversity Day,42,Jim,"That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, ""100% post-consumer content."" What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you.  Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.",
1,2,Diversity Day,42,Jim,Do you really have to do that right now?,
1,2,Diversity Day,42,Dwight,Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.,
1,2,Diversity Day,42,Jim,"Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks.  Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying...  Hello? Thanks, Dwight.",
1,2,Diversity Day,42,Dwight,Retaliation. Tit for tit.,
1,2,Diversity Day,42,Jim,That is not the expression.,
1,2,Diversity Day,42,Dwight,"Well, it should be.",
1,2,Diversity Day,43,Jim,"This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?",
1,2,Diversity Day,44,Jim,Solitaire?,
1,2,Diversity Day,44,Pam,"Yeah, Freecell.",
1,2,Diversity Day,44,Jim,Six on seven.,
1,2,Diversity Day,44,Pam,I know. I saw that.,
1,2,Diversity Day,44,Jim,"So then, why didn't you do it?",
1,2,Diversity Day,44,Pam,I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.,
1,2,Diversity Day,44,Jim,Who doesn't love that?,
1,2,Diversity Day,45,Michael,"Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?",
1,2,Diversity Day,45,Oscar,All right.,
1,2,Diversity Day,45,Michael,Did you have a good weekend going there?,
1,2,Diversity Day,45,Oscar,It was fine.,
1,2,Diversity Day,45,Michael,"Oh yeah, I bet it was fun.  Oh, hey! This is Oscar---",
1,2,Diversity Day,45,Oscar,Martinez.,
1,2,Diversity Day,45,Michael,"Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!",
1,2,Diversity Day,45,Mr. Brown,Great. We're all set.,
1,2,Diversity Day,45,Michael,"Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?",
1,2,Diversity Day,45,Jim,"Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.",
1,2,Diversity Day,45,Michael,"It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.",
1,2,Diversity Day,45,Jim,You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,"Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,"Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,"You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race.",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,"Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind.",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,"Exactly, were not...",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,With tolerance.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,No. With more ignorance.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,Ignorance.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,"Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity.",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,Let's celebrate.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,Right. OK.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,"Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that...",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Dwight,I have two. White and Indian.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,"Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,Yes.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,OK.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,"Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Dwight,A few of the ground rules?,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,"Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Dwight,"OK, can we steer away from gay people?",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,Um...,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Dwight,"I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,"Well, we only have an hour.",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Dwight,I figured it would save time.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,Mr. Brown.,
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Michael,"Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.",
1,2,Diversity Day,46,Mr. Brown,"Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.",
1,2,Diversity Day,47,Michael,"How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?",
1,2,Diversity Day,48,Mr. Brown,So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.,
1,2,Diversity Day,48,Michael,I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.,
1,2,Diversity Day,48,Mr. Brown,"Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment.",
1,2,Diversity Day,48,Michael,"OK, I will play guy listening.",
1,2,Diversity Day,48,Mr. Brown,"Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?",
1,2,Diversity Day,48,Kevin,I remember.,
1,2,Diversity Day,48,Mr. Brown,Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.,
1,2,Diversity Day,48,Michael,OK.,
1,2,Diversity Day,49,Michael,Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.,
1,2,Diversity Day,50,Kevin,"Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.",
1,2,Diversity Day,50,Michael,"OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me...  Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass...  I take care of my kid!",
1,2,Diversity Day,50,Mr. Brown,Wait a second.,
1,2,Diversity Day,50,Michael, They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!,
1,2,Diversity Day,50,Mr. Brown,Stop it!,
1,2,Diversity Day,50,Michael, What you want a cookie?,
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Mr. Brown,"Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.",
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Dwight,"Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.",
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Mr. Brown,"Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?",
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Dwight,"A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.",
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Mr. Brown,OK.,
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Dwight,"A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.",
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Mr. Brown,"Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.",
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Dwight,We all have a hero in our heart.,
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Mr. Brown,"Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.",
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Michael, I don't think I can sign this.,
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Mr. Brown,I can't leave until you do.,
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Michael,"Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?",
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Mr. Brown,"Michael, can I talk to you candidly?",
1,2,Diversity Day,51,Michael,Sure.,
1,2,Diversity Day,52,Mr. Brown,We both know that I'm here because of the comments you made.,
1,2,Diversity Day,52,Michael,"Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.",
1,2,Diversity Day,52,Mr. Brown,"Um, it's not throwing me. I need your signature.",
1,2,Diversity Day,52,Michael,"OK, well I know. You told me that several times.",
1,2,Diversity Day,52,Mr. Brown,"Yes, but you're not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.",
1,2,Diversity Day,52,Michael,OK.,
1,2,Diversity Day,52,Mr. Brown,Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn't be embarrassed.,
1,2,Diversity Day,52,Michael,"Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.",
1,2,Diversity Day,52,Mr. Brown,Don't worry about dating.,
1,2,Diversity Day,52,Michael,I won't.,
1,2,Diversity Day,52,Mr. Brown,OK. Thank you.,
1,2,Diversity Day,52,Michael,"Yeah, yeah.",
1,2,Diversity Day,53,Michael,"""I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness..."" Open-mindedness, is that even a word? ""...into the workplace. In this way, I can truly be a hero. Signed, Daffy Duck.""  He's going to lose it when he reads that.",
1,2,Diversity Day,54,Jim,"Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.",
1,2,Diversity Day,54,Michael,"""I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart."" I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, ""Mr. Brown,"" he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.",
1,2,Diversity Day,55,Michael,All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.,
1,2,Diversity Day,55,Toby,"Hey, we're not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? ",
1,2,Diversity Day,55,Michael,Get out.,
1,2,Diversity Day,55,Toby,I'm sorry.,
1,2,Diversity Day,55,Michael,"No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.",
1,2,Diversity Day,56,Michael," Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, ""If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North."" And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Jim,": Uh, is that it?",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Kevin,It was kind of hard to hear.,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,"Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Kelly,I have a customer meeting.,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,"Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Oscar,What part Native American?,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,Two fifteenths.,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Oscar,"Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn't make any sense.",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,"Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Oscar,"OK, Michael, um... Both my parents were born in Mexico.",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,"Oh, yeah...",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Oscar,"And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,Wow.,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Oscar,My parents were Mexican.,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,"Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Oscar,Thank... Yeah...,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,"Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Oscar,Mexican isn't offensive.,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,"Well, it has certain connotations.",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Oscar,Like what?,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,Like... I don't... I don't know.,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Oscar,"What connotations, Michael? You meant something.",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,"No. Now, remember that honesty...",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Oscar,I'm just curious.,
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Michael,"...empathy, respect...  Jim! Jim!",
1,2,Diversity Day,57,Jim,Hello? Hello?,
1,2,Diversity Day,58,Michael,"I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so... I want you to really go for it, cause this is real. You know, this isn't just an exercise. This is real life. And... I have a dream that you will really let the sparks fly. Get 'er done.",
1,2,Diversity Day,59,Michael,Why? Because Martin Luther King is a hero of mine. There's this great Chris Rock bit about how streets named after Martin Luther King tend to be more violent. I'm not going to do it but it's...,
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Michael,Oh this is a good one.,
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Pam,"Um, hi. How are you?",
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Stanley,Fine. How are you?,
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Pam,Great.,
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Michael,Push it.,
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Stanley,I admire your culture's success in America.,
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Pam,Thank you.,
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Michael,Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.,
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Stanley,Who am I supposed to be?,
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Michael,"No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.",
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Dwight,"Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.",
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Dwight,Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.,
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Pam,"That's nice, Dwight.",
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Dwight,"OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.",
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Pam,"OK, I like your food.",
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Dwight,"Outback steakhouse.  I'm Australian, mate!",
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Michael,"Pam, come on. ""I like your food."" Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.",
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Pam,"OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver.",
1,2,Diversity Day,60,Dwight,"Oh, man, am I a woman?",
1,2,Diversity Day,61,Michael,"You'll notice I didn't have anybody be an Arab. I thought that would be too explosive. No pun intended. But I just though. ""Too soon for Arabs."" Maybe next year. Um... You know, the ball's in their court.",
1,2,Diversity Day,62,Jim,What are you watching?,
1,2,Diversity Day,62,Ryan,Chappelle's Show.,
1,2,Diversity Day,62,Jim,Really?,
1,2,Diversity Day,62,Ryan,I downloaded it on her computer. I hope she doesn't mind. She just had a lot of extra space.,
1,2,Diversity Day,62,Jim,No way. I think she likes this stuff.,
1,2,Diversity Day,62,Ryan,"Great. She's cute, huh?",
1,2,Diversity Day,62,Jim,"Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...",
1,2,Diversity Day,62,Ryan,"Oh, no, the girl in the... sketch.",
1,2,Diversity Day,62,Jim,"Oh, yeah. She's hot.",
1,2,Diversity Day,63,Kevin,Hey.,
1,2,Diversity Day,63,Angela,Hey.,
1,2,Diversity Day,63,Kevin,You wanna go to the beach?,
1,2,Diversity Day,63,Angela,Sure.,
1,2,Diversity Day,63,Kevin,You wanna get high?,
1,2,Diversity Day,63,Angela,No.,
1,2,Diversity Day,63,Kevin,"I think you do, mon.",
1,2,Diversity Day,63,Angela,Stop...,
1,2,Diversity Day,63,Michael,OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.,
1,2,Diversity Day,64,Michael," Kelly, how are you?",
1,2,Diversity Day,64,Kelly,I just had the longest meeting.,
1,2,Diversity Day,64,Michael,"Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi. Try my... ",
1,2,Diversity Day,64,Michael," All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.",
1,2,Diversity Day,65,Jim," Mr. Decker, we didn't lose your sale today, did we? Excellent. OK. Let me just get your... what's that? No, we didn't close last time. I just need your... Oh. W-What code were you given? Oh, OK. That's actually another salesman here. I can redo it if you want to do that. Oh, he gave you a discount? No, I don't blame you.",
1,2,Diversity Day,66,Michael,"I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.",
1,2,Diversity Day,66,Kevin,Maybe some spagh-etti.,
1,2,Diversity Day,66,Michael,"Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.",
1,2,Diversity Day,66,Stanley,It's collard greens.,
1,2,Diversity Day,66,Michael,What?,
1,2,Diversity Day,66,Stanley,It's collard greens.,
1,2,Diversity Day,66,Michael,"That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.",
1,2,Diversity Day,67,Jim, Um... Hey.,
1,2,Diversity Day,67,Pam, Mmmm.,

1,2,Diversity Day,67,Pam,Sorry.,
1,2,Diversity Day,67,Jim,That's fine.,
1,2,Diversity Day,68,Jim,Uh... Not a bad day.,
1,3,Health Care,69,Michael,Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.,
1,3,Health Care,69,Pam,I'm not making any copies.,

1,3,Health Care,69,Pam,Nothing new.,
1,3,Health Care,69,Michael,Lay them on me. What?,
1,3,Health Care,69,Pam,There's nothing new.,
1,3,Health Care,69,Michael,That's not what you said earlier.,
1,3,Health Care,69,Pam,"Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... ",
1,3,Health Care,70,Michael,"The most sacred thing I do is care and provide for my workers, my family. I give them money. I give them food. Not directly, but through the money. I heal them. Today, I am in charge of picking a great new health care plan. Right? That's what this is all about. Does that make me their doctor? Um... Yes, in a way. Yeah, like a specialist.",
1,3,Health Care,71,Jan,"So, which health plan have you decided on?",
1,3,Health Care,71,Michael,"I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.",
1,3,Health Care,71,Jan,"Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?",
1,3,Health Care,71,Michael,I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.,
1,3,Health Care,71,Jan,The Gold Plan? I'm not even on that plan.,
1,3,Health Care,71,Michael,"Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.",
1,3,Health Care,71,Jan,Michael.,
1,3,Health Care,71,Michael,You gotta crack these things open.,
1,3,Health Care,71,Jan,"You know the whole reason that we're doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.",
1,3,Health Care,71,Michael,"Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.",
1,3,Health Care,71,Jan,It's your job. So...,
1,3,Health Care,71,Michael,"Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.",
1,3,Health Care,71,Jan,Michael... maybe... I mean...,
1,3,Health Care,71,Michael,"There, there...",
1,3,Health Care,71,Jan,"Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.",
1,3,Health Care,71,Michael, When have you ever done that?,
1,3,Health Care,71,Jan,I'm doing it right now. To you.,
1,3,Health Care,72,Jim,"Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?",
1,3,Health Care,72,Pam,No. I have a life.,
1,3,Health Care,72,Jim,"Interesting, what's that like?",
1,3,Health Care,72,Pam,You should try it sometime.,
1,3,Health Care,72,Jim,Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...,
1,3,Health Care,72,Pam,... your problem.,
1,3,Health Care,72,Michael,Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.,
1,3,Health Care,73,Michael,"There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.",
1,3,Health Care,73,Jim,Gosh.,
1,3,Health Care,73,Michael,Yeah!,
1,3,Health Care,73,Jim,That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.,
1,3,Health Care,73,Michael,Really?,
1,3,Health Care,73,Jim,"Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?",
1,3,Health Care,74,Jim,"Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.",
1,3,Health Care,75,Dwight,Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.,
1,3,Health Care,76,Jim,"Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.",
1,3,Health Care,77,Dwight,"OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?",
1,3,Health Care,77,Michael,"Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.",
1,3,Health Care,77,Dwight,"OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.",
1,3,Health Care,77,Michael,You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.,
1,3,Health Care,77,Dwight," Yes, I have an office.  Bigger than his.",
1,3,Health Care,77,Michael,"Nope, you cannot use it.",
1,3,Health Care,77,Dwight,"OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.",
1,3,Health Care,77,Michael,Temporary workspace. You can use it.,
1,3,Health Care,77,Dwight,Thank you.,
1,3,Health Care,78,Michael,"If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.",
1,3,Health Care,79,Dwight,What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.,
1,3,Health Care,79,Dwight,"In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, ""Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead."" Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.",
1,3,Health Care,80,Stanley,"There's no dental, there's no vision, there's a $1,200 deductible.",
1,3,Health Care,81,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",
1,3,Health Care,81,Michael," Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?",
1,3,Health Care,81,Pam,Where are you?,
1,3,Health Care,81,Michael,"Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?",
1,3,Health Care,81,Pam,"Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...",
1,3,Health Care,81,Michael,"Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.",
1,3,Health Care,81,Pam,No you're not.,
1,3,Health Care,81,Michael,"I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?",
1,3,Health Care,81,Pam,OK.,
1,3,Health Care,81,Michael,"Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.",
1,3,Health Care,81,Pam,Still no one calling.,
1,3,Health Care,82,Pam,"Dwight, what...",
1,3,Health Care,82,Dwight,"Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.",
1,3,Health Care,82,Jim,"It says ""workspace"".",
1,3,Health Care,82,Dwight,Same thing.,
1,3,Health Care,82,Jim,"If it's the same thing, then why did you write ""workspace""?",
1,3,Health Care,82,Dwight,"Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.",
1,3,Health Care,82,Jim,You are not my superior.,
1,3,Health Care,82,Dwight,"Oh gee, then why do I have an office?",
1,3,Health Care,82,Jim,I thought it was a workspace?,
1,3,Health Care,82,Pam,OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?,
1,3,Health Care,82,Dwight,Yes. And my decision in final.,
1,3,Health Care,82,Pam,This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.,
1,3,Health Care,82,Dwight,"Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.",
1,3,Health Care,82,Jim,"You cut more than you had to, didn't you?",
1,3,Health Care,82,Dwight,Sure.,
1,3,Health Care,82,Jim,"Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?",
1,3,Health Care,82,Dwight,Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.,
1,3,Health Care,82,Jim,"OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.",
1,3,Health Care,82,Dwight,"I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.",
1,3,Health Care,82,Pam,Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?,
1,3,Health Care,82,Dwight,So I can lower it.,
1,3,Health Care,83,Oscar,He literally won't come out of his office.,
1,3,Health Care,83,Kevin,He's got to come out sometime. To go to the bathroom.,
1,3,Health Care,83,Angela,Kevin! That's inappropriate.,
1,3,Health Care,84,Oscar,"Michael, can I talk to you?",
1,3,Health Care,84,Michael,"Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?",
1,3,Health Care,84,Meredith,"Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?",
1,3,Health Care,84,Michael,"Ah, what? Which memo?",
1,3,Health Care,84,Pam,Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.,
1,3,Health Care,84,Michael,Is it a good plan?,
1,3,Health Care,84,Dwight,It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.,
1,3,Health Care,84,Oscar,It's like a pay decrease.,
1,3,Health Care,84,Pam,"Michael, he made huge cuts.",
1,3,Health Care,84,Michael,"Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?",
1,3,Health Care,84,Dwight,"Yeah, you said...",
1,3,Health Care,84,Michael,"No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?",
1,3,Health Care,84,Dwight,I can handle that.,
1,3,Health Care,84,Michael,"OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?",
1,3,Health Care,85,Oscar,This is not good.,
1,3,Health Care,85,Angela,It's ridiculous. Did you talk to him?,
1,3,Health Care,85,Oscar,What was that?,
1,3,Health Care,85,Angela,You let him walk all over you. It's just pathetic.,
1,3,Health Care,85,Kevin,What are you guys talking about?,
1,3,Health Care,85,Angela,"Nothing, Kevin.",
1,3,Health Care,86,Dwight,"OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.",
1,3,Health Care,86,Jim,"OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.",
1,3,Health Care,86,Dwight,"OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.",
1,3,Health Care,86,Jim,Workspace.,
1,3,Health Care,87,Michael,You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.,
1,3,Health Care,87,Pam,Where are you going?,
1,3,Health Care,87,Michael,"Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings.  Couldn't find the knob.",
1,3,Health Care,88,Michael,"So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.",
1,3,Health Care,88,Travel Agent,"I don't know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?",
1,3,Health Care,88,Michael,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...",
1,3,Health Care,89,Jim,Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.,
1,3,Health Care,89,Pam,I'm inventing new diseases.,
1,3,Health Care,89,Jim,"Oh, great.",
1,3,Health Care,89,Pam,"So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?",
1,3,Health Care,89,Jim,I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.,
1,3,Health Care,89,Pam,Nice.,
1,3,Health Care,89,Jim,Thank you.,
1,3,Health Care,90,Michael," Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.",
1,3,Health Care,90,Man on Phone,You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It's not really a ride.,
1,3,Health Care,90,Michael,Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.,
1,3,Health Care,90,Man on Phone,"It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.",
1,3,Health Care,90,Michael,So it's not a free fall?,
1,3,Health Care,90,Man on Phone,It's an industrial coal elevator.,
1,3,Health Care,90,Michael,"Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?",
1,3,Health Care,91,Michael,"OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?",
1,3,Health Care,92,Dwight,Damnit! Damnit Jim!,
1,3,Health Care,92,Dwight,"All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.",
1,3,Health Care,92,Jim,What are you talking about?,
1,3,Health Care,92,Dwight,"Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.",
1,3,Health Care,92,Jim,"OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?",
1,3,Health Care,92,Dwight,"Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.",
1,3,Health Care,92,Dwight,"You did this, didn't you?",
1,3,Health Care,92,Jim,Absolutely not.,
1,3,Health Care,92,Dwight,Yes you did.,
1,3,Health Care,92,Jim,No I didn't.,
1,3,Health Care,92,Dwight,"I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!",
1,3,Health Care,93,Jim,Killer nanorobots?,
1,3,Health Care,93,Pam,It's an epidemic.,
1,3,Health Care,94,Dwight,"The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff.  ""Count Choculitis""",
1,3,Health Care,94,Jim,Sounds tough.,
1,3,Health Care,94,Dwight,Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?,
1,3,Health Care,94,Jim,Do you?,
1,3,Health Care,94,Dwight,I think you need to confess...,
1,3,Health Care,94,Jim,Mmm hmm.,
1,3,Health Care,94,Dwight,...the fact...,
1,3,Health Care,94,Jim,Yep.,
1,3,Health Care,94,Dwight,What are you doing? Those are my keys.,

1,3,Health Care,95,Pam,"Good, how are you? Busy?",

1,3,Health Care,96,Dwight,Well...,
1,3,Health Care,96,Jan,Where's Michael Scott?,
1,3,Health Care,96,Dwight,He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.,
1,3,Health Care,96,Jan,"Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?",
1,3,Health Care,96,Dwight,"That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.",
1,3,Health Care,96,Jan,Really?,
1,3,Health Care,96,Dwight,Yeah.,
1,3,Health Care,96,Jan,"OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.",

1,3,Health Care,97,Dwight,Michael. Michael?,
1,3,Health Care,97,Michael," Oh, Christ.",
1,3,Health Care,98,Dwight,"I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.",
1,3,Health Care,99,Dwight,"I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.",
1,3,Health Care,99,Stanley,What about confidentiality?,

1,3,Health Care,104,Michael," God, yeah... Ah! This...",
1,3,Health Care,105,Michael,"Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting.  ""Hi. I'm Mork from Ork."" Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.",

1,4,The Alliance,107,Dwight,"Yeah, so I don't have to worry?",
1,4,The Alliance,107,Michael,"Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?",

1,4,The Alliance,107,Dwight,Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?,
1,4,The Alliance,107,Michael,"Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.",
1,4,The Alliance,108,Michael,"It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, ""You're fired.""  ""You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed."" It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way.  ""You're foir-ed."" I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, ""You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want."" But that's unrealistic, so...",
1,4,The Alliance,109,Dwight,"It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.",
1,4,The Alliance,110,Stanley,Why'd you do this?,
1,4,The Alliance,110,Dwight,"I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?",
1,4,The Alliance,111,Michael,"Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam... Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is... drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?",
1,4,The Alliance,111,Michael,Who is it? Who's the birthday?,

1,4,The Alliance,111,Pam,But it's not until next month.,
1,4,The Alliance,111,Michael,"Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.",
1,4,The Alliance,111,Pam,You still want to have a party?,
1,4,The Alliance,111,Michael,"Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!",
1,4,The Alliance,111,Michael," Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.",
1,4,The Alliance,112,Phyllis,"Well, uh, for decorations, maybe we could... it's stupid, forget it.",
1,4,The Alliance,112,Angela,What?,
1,4,The Alliance,112,Phyllis,"I was just going to say, maybe we could have streamers, but that's dumb, everybody has streamers. Never mind.",
1,4,The Alliance,112,Angela,"No, yeah, I think that's a good idea.",
1,4,The Alliance,112,Phyllis,Yeah?,
1,4,The Alliance,112,Angela,What color do you guys think?,
1,4,The Alliance,112,Phyllis,"Well, there's green, um, blue... yellow... red...",
1,4,The Alliance,112,Pam,How about green?,
1,4,The Alliance,112,Angela,I think green is kind of whoreish.,
1,4,The Alliance,113,Pam,This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.,
1,4,The Alliance,114,Michael,These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!,
1,4,The Alliance,114,Michael,"So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.",
1,4,The Alliance,114,Angela,"Meredith's allergic to dairy, so...",
1,4,The Alliance,114,Michael,"She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so...",
1,4,The Alliance,114,Pam,It is... her birthday.,
1,4,The Alliance,114,Michael,"Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?",
1,4,The Alliance,115,Dwight,"Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.",
1,4,The Alliance,115,Dwight,"Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?",
1,4,The Alliance,115,Jim,"Absolutely, I do.",
1,4,The Alliance,115,Dwight,"Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...",
1,4,The Alliance,116,Jim,"At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.",
1,4,The Alliance,117,Dwight,Did you get your tickets?,
1,4,The Alliance,117,Jim,To what?,
1,4,The Alliance,117,Dwight,The gun show. ,
1,4,The Alliance,118,Jim,"And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says ""No, Jim, here's a way.""",
1,4,The Alliance,119,Dwight,There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.,
1,4,The Alliance,120,Pam,An alliance?,
1,4,The Alliance,120,Jim,Oh yeah.,
1,4,The Alliance,120,Pam,What does that even mean?,
1,4,The Alliance,120,Jim,"I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.",
1,4,The Alliance,120,Jim,"Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.",
1,4,The Alliance,120,Dwight,"Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?",
1,4,The Alliance,121,Dwight,Did you tell Pam about the alliance?,
1,4,The Alliance,121,Jim,What? No.,
1,4,The Alliance,121,Dwight,Just now.,
1,4,The Alliance,121,Jim,"What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.",
1,4,The Alliance,121,Dwight,"Right, that's good, good, pursue this.",
1,4,The Alliance,121,Jim,Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?,
1,4,The Alliance,121,Dwight,Mmm hmm.,
1,4,The Alliance,121,Jim,"But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.",
1,4,The Alliance,121,Dwight,Done.,
1,4,The Alliance,121,Jim,All right.,
1,4,The Alliance,122,Michael," Can you get her? She's right there.  That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day.  Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, ""Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers."" Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, ""Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael."" ",
1,4,The Alliance,123,Dwight,"They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?",
1,4,The Alliance,123,Jim,"Yeah, what do you think that's about?",

1,4,The Alliance,139,Jim,Right... That's good.,

1,4,The Alliance,144,Pam," Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...",
1,4,The Alliance,144,Dwight, Oh.,
1,4,The Alliance,145,Michael,"Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.",
1,4,The Alliance,145,Jim,"Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?",
1,4,The Alliance,145,Michael,"Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.",
1,4,The Alliance,145,Jim,"Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.",
1,4,The Alliance,145,Michael,Is Oscar around?,
1,4,The Alliance,146,Michael,"I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so...",
1,4,The Alliance,146,Oscar,"Well, that's what a walk-a-thon is.",
1,4,The Alliance,146,Michael,I know...,
1,4,The Alliance,146,Oscar,"It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, ""However many dollars per mile.""",
1,4,The Alliance,146,Michael,Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...,
1,4,The Alliance,146,Oscar,I just think it's kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.,
1,4,The Alliance,146,Michael,"No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?",
1,4,The Alliance,146,Oscar,Yeah.,

1,4,The Alliance,147,Michael,Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.,
1,4,The Alliance,147,Meredith,"No, I... I get it. It's funny.",
1,4,The Alliance,147,Michael," You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... ""Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back."" 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?",
1,4,The Alliance,147,Meredith,You're right. You're right. Yes.,

Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, ""This might be kinda fun."" And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans!

1,5,Basketball,163,Michael,"Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. ",

1,6,Hot Girl,205,Roy,What are you gay?,
1,6,Hot Girl,205,Jim,"Hmmm, I don't think so. Nope.",
1,6,Hot Girl,205,Kevin,What is your type?,
1,6,Hot Girl,205,Jim," Moms, primarily. Yep. Soccer moms. Single moms. NASCAR moms. Any type of moms, really.",
1,6,Hot Girl,205,Roy,That's disgusting.,
1,6,Hot Girl,205,Kevin,Stay away from my mom.,
1,6,Hot Girl,205,Jim,"Too late, Kev.",
1,6,Hot Girl,205,Roy," Man, I would be all over that if I wasn't dating Pam.",
1,6,Hot Girl,205,Pam,"We're not dating, we're engaged.",
1,6,Hot Girl,205,Roy,"Engaged, yeah.",
1,6,Hot Girl,206,Jim,"Pam and I are good buddies. I'm sort of Pam's go-to guy for her problems. You know with stuff like work, or uh, her fiance Roy. Or uh... Nope, those are pretty much her only two problems.",
1,6,Hot Girl,207,Jim,She'd be perfect for you.,
1,6,Hot Girl,207,Dwight,Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.,
1,6,Hot Girl,207,Jim,"So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.",
1,6,Hot Girl,207,Dwight,Assistant to the Regional Manager.,
1,6,Hot Girl,207,Jim,"Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.",
1,6,Hot Girl,207,Dwight,That's true.,
1,6,Hot Girl,207,Jim,"Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.",
1,6,Hot Girl,207,Dwight,True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.,
1,6,Hot Girl,207,Jim,It's all gold.,
1,6,Hot Girl,208,Katy,"Guys are usually my best customers, they buy the high end stuff like the beads and the sequins and stuff. For gifts, you know? They don't know what they are looking at. So I make suggestions.",
1,6,Hot Girl,209,Jim,"Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.",
1,6,Hot Girl,209,Dwight,What's that?,
1,6,Hot Girl,209,Jim,You buy a purse.,
1,6,Hot Girl,209,Dwight,I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.,
1,6,Hot Girl,209,Jim,"Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?",
1,6,Hot Girl,209,Dwight,No.,
1,6,Hot Girl,209,Jim,"Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them.",
1,6,Hot Girl,209,Dwight,Like those?,
1,6,Hot Girl,209,Jim,"Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.",
1,6,Hot Girl,209,Dwight,"Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...",
1,6,Hot Girl,209,Jim,No. You don't need the bathroom. You've got it. Go.,
1,6,Hot Girl,210,Jim,"Okay, shhhh stop... stop whatever you're doing because this is going to be good.",
1,6,Hot Girl,210,Jim," Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta?",
1,6,Hot Girl,210,Pam," Oh definitely, definitely step in and out of it like that.",
1,6,Hot Girl,210,Jim,"Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens.",
1,6,Hot Girl,210,Pam,Oh!,
1,6,Hot Girl,210,Jim,Oh! That was really.  This is necessary to do to really give it a good workout. This is the ooooh... This is the prettiest one of all.,
1,6,Hot Girl,210,Pam,Oh...,
1,6,Hot Girl,210,Jim,"I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball. Oh, how much?",
1,6,Hot Girl,210,Pam,"Oh, God. It's sad. It's so sad.",
1,6,Hot Girl,210,Jim," Here he comes, shhh...",
1,6,Hot Girl,210,Jim, Good.,

1,6,Hot Girl,210,Pam,You're horrible.,
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Katy,This one's really good for a hot date.,
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Pam,"Yeah, what's that?",
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Pam,I'm engaged. So...,
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Katy,Congratulations. You need a hot date more than anyone.,
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Pam,"I wished, right?",
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Michael,"Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?  So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?",
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Katy,Good.,
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Michael,"Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?",
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Katy, Sorry.,
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Michael,Busted.,
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Katy, Come back...,
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Michael,"Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.",
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Katy,Is that from Starbucks?,
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Michael,Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.,
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Katy,Wow. Is that for the office?,
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Michael,"Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!",
1,6,Hot Girl,211,Katy,I wouldn't think of it.,
1,6,Hot Girl,212,Michael,"Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!",
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Michael," Oh the rotating um, steam wand.  What? What's the matter?",
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Katy,"Oh, nothing. My ride just bailed on me.",
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Michael,"Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?",
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Katy,"Oh no, it's um...",
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Michael,Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.,

1,6,Hot Girl,213,Michael,"Seriously. No, really.",
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Katy,No. I really don't want to inconvenience you.,
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Michael,"God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp.",
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Katy,At five?,
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Michael,"I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves.",
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Katy,Okay.,
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Michael,What?,
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Katy,"Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.",
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Michael,Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home.,
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Katy,Okay. Cool.,
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Michael,Excellent.,
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Katy,Cool.,
1,6,Hot Girl,213,Michael,"Great. Cool. Cool.  Yeah, okay.",
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Michael,I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..,
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Dwight,It's actually better this way.,
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Michael,No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---,
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Dwight,Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...,
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Michael,"No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not.",
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Dwight,"Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.",
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Michael,But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.,
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Dwight,What?,
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Michael,She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.,
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Dwight,Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?,
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Michael,"Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...",
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Dwight,"Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?",
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Michael,No. I cannot promise you that.,
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Dwight,"You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?",
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Michael,"Listen, Dwight.",
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Dwight,Do you love her?,
1,6,Hot Girl,214,Michael," Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel. ",
1,6,Hot Girl,215,Katy,"I think you've made a really good choice, she's really going to like that.",
1,6,Hot Girl,215,Stanley,Hmmm...,
1,6,Hot Girl,215,Michael,Espresso?,
1,6,Hot Girl,215,Katy,"Oh, thank you.",
1,6,Hot Girl,215,Michael,You're welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm.,
1,6,Hot Girl,215,Stanley,Is that from the machine that was in your office?,
1,6,Hot Girl,215,Michael,Ummm-hmmm...,
1,6,Hot Girl,215,Stanley,I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.,
1,6,Hot Girl,215,Michael,Very easy to clean.,
1,6,Hot Girl,215,Michael,"Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right? ",
1,6,Hot Girl,216,Michael,Did we get any mail?,
1,6,Hot Girl,216,Pam,"Yeah, I gave it to you.",
1,6,Hot Girl,216,Michael,"Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...",
1,6,Hot Girl,216,Pam,"So, can I..? ",
1,6,Hot Girl,216,Michael,"Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?",
1,6,Hot Girl,217,Jim,A futon?,
1,6,Hot Girl,217,Jim,He's a grown man,
1,6,Hot Girl,217,Pam,That's what he said.,
1,6,Hot Girl,217,Jim,"That's sad. Or it's innovative. Well, you know the futon is a bed and couch all rolled into one. ",
1,6,Hot Girl,217,Roy,What's up?,
1,6,Hot Girl,217,Pam, Hi.,
1,6,Hot Girl,217,Roy,Are you still mad at me?,

1,6,Hot Girl,217,Pam, Cut it out.,
1,6,Hot Girl,217,Roy,Are you mad at me now?,
1,6,Hot Girl,217,Pam,Stop. ,
1,6,Hot Girl,217,Roy,"Huh? huh? Come on... Come on, Pammy I was just kidding.",
1,6,Hot Girl,217,Pam," Stop, I can't breathe.",
1,6,Hot Girl,217,Roy,I was just kidding. You know I didn't mean it. I can't...,
1,6,Hot Girl,218,Pam,Jim is a great guy. He's like a brother to me. We're like best friends in the office and I really hope he finds someone.,
1,6,Hot Girl,219,Katy,You seem to like to touch things. Did you try the velvet?,
1,6,Hot Girl,219,Angela,I don't like to necessarily touch things. I'm just... I'm shopping.,

1,6,Hot Girl,225,Michael,"I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say?

If I had to choose between a one-night-stand with some stupid cow I pick-up in a bar, and these people? I'd pick them every time. Because with them, it is an everyday stand and I still know their names in the morning.",
2,1,The Dundies,228,Michael,"Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin.  And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, ""Hey, did you get an award?"" And the neighbor will say, ""No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me."" Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition. So...",
2,1,The Dundies,229,Jim,"So, you ready for the... the Dundies?",
2,1,The Dundies,229,Pam,Ugh...,
2,1,The Dundies,230,Pam,"You know what they say about a car wreck, where it's so awful you can't look away? The Dundies are like a car wreck that you want to look away, but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you.",
2,1,The Dundies,231,Michael, Hey hey hey! It's Fat Halpert.,
2,1,The Dundies,231,Jim,What?,
2,1,The Dundies,231,Michael, Fat Halpert.  Jim Halpert.,
2,1,The Dundies,232,Michael,"So why don't I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners. We got Fat Jim Halpert here. Jim, why don't you show of your Dundies to the camera?",
2,1,The Dundies,232,Jim,"Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky.",
2,1,The Dundies,232,Michael,"Oh, that's a good idea.",
2,1,The Dundies,232,Dwight,Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.,
2,1,The Dundies,232,Michael,Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.,
2,1,The Dundies,233,Michael,"T.M.I.? Too much information. Ah, it's just easier to say T.M.I. I used to say ""Don't go there"" but that's... lame.",
2,1,The Dundies,234,Michael,"And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling.",
2,1,The Dundies,234,Stanley,"I don't know where they are, I think I threw them out.",
2,1,The Dundies,234,Michael,"Oh, no you di-int.",
2,1,The Dundies,234,Stanley,I think I did.,
2,1,The Dundies,234,Michael,W-why did you...,
2,1,The Dundies,234,Stanley,"Say, we got to order some more apa-teezers this time. We ran out last year, remember?",
2,1,The Dundies,234,Michael,"Yes we should. I... you know what? I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage,  someone had eaten all of them.",
2,1,The Dundies,235,Michael," To Oscar Martinez it's the ""Show Me the Money"" award! Yeah!",
2,1,The Dundies,236,Oscar, That's supposed to be confidential.,
2,1,The Dundies,236,Michael," He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!",
2,1,The Dundies,236,Michael," A little bit of Paaam, all night long, a little bit of Angela on the thing...",
2,1,The Dundies,236,Michael,...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...,
2,1,The Dundies,236,Pam,"Oh, yeah, this is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night. It's great.",
2,1,The Dundies,236,Michael," ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...",
2,1,The Dundies,237,Kelly,It was you.,
2,1,The Dundies,237,Phyllis,Live and learn.,
2,1,The Dundies,237,Pam, It wasn't. I swear.,
2,1,The Dundies,237,Kelly,"Yeah, it was.",
2,1,The Dundies,238,Dwight,"So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.",
2,1,The Dundies,238,Pam,"We're not laughing at you, Dwight.",
2,1,The Dundies,238,Dwight,So who are we laughing at?,
2,1,The Dundies,238,Pam,"Um, just something somebody wrote.",
2,1,The Dundies,238,Dwight,Who? Dave Barry?,

2,2,Sexual Harassment,288,Todd Packer,"They are women, right?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,288,Michael,Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,288,Todd Packer,"I said it. And then, suddenly, for no reason, this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,288,Michael,"Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,289,Jim,"Hey, um... what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer?  This guy!",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,290,Todd Packer,"Meant to ask you, can you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the, uh, DUI situation?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,290,Michael,Oh. Bad boy.  Um... Ryan? ,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,290,Todd Packer," Come on, kid. Let's go.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,290,Michael,Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,290,Jim,Except pass that breathalyzer.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,291,Ryan,You a big William Hung fan?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,291,Todd Packer,Why does everyone ask me that? Who the hell is that?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,292,Jim,I'm really excited to meet your Mom.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,292,Pam,You are?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,293,Pam,My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,294,Pam,I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,294,Jim,Oh yeah?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,294,Pam,mmhmm.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,294,Jim,Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,294,Pam,Oh really?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,294,Jim,"Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,295,Michael,"Hey, send me that link to the monkey s*x video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,295,Dwight,Yes!,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,295,Michael,"Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. ""Old School"".",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,295,Toby,Michael?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,295,Michael,"Yes, Toby?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,295,Toby,Um... I need to talk to you in your office. It'll just take two seconds.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,295,Michael,Um... literally two seconds?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,296,Michael,Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,297,Toby,The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment. So Corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,297,Michael,"No, no, Toby. No.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,297,Toby,"It's really not a big deal, Michael.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,297,Michael,"It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,297,Toby,And then Corporate is going to send in a lawyer...,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,297,Michael,What?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,297,Toby,Just to refresh you... .,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,297,Michael,NO!,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,297,Toby,on our policy.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,297,Michael,"What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,297,Toby,Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,297,Michael,There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,298,Michael,"Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day.  So, take it away.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,298,Toby,"Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,298,Michael,"I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,299,Michael,"A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says ""Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?"" This is what's at stake.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Michael,"Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are.  Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Darryl,Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Michael,"Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Darryl,"Well,  those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Roy,Boys R Us!,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Warehouse Guy,Oh!,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Michael,"Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Darryl,"Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Michael,"Oooh, okay. That was still about me.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Roy,"Hey, hey, hey.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Michael,What?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Roy,So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Michael,I don't feel bad.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Darryl, I think he feels bad.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Michael,"No, I don't.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Roy,You look like you feel bad.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Michael,Okay.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Roy,Little package!,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Michael,"Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Warehouse guy,Little package! Little package!,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Michael,Thank you.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Roy,You look good.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,300,Darryl,Hiding from his momma.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,301,Toby,"So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,301,Pam,"Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,301,Kevin,MILF!,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,301,Pam,"Thanks, Kevin.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,302,Pam,Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Pam,She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Toby,Great point.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Pam,Thank you.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Toby,"Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Michael,"Hi, is it over?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Toby,"Uh, yes!",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Michael,No.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Toby,I can go over it with you.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Michael,"I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Toby,It's over.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Michael,"Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Angela,Email forwards.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Michael,Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Angela,I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Michael,"Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Stanley,That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Meredith,Um... what about office romance?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Toby,"Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Phyllis,"All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Michael,"I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Dwight,"Yeah, Meredith.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Michael,No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Dwight,Yes.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Michael,She would have definitely slept with me.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Kevin,She wasn't that hot.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Michael,"Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,303,Toby,"Ok, you know, Michael...",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,304,Jim,"I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,305,Michael,"What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her ""partner"" in to work?  Would that be crossing the line?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,305,Toby,No.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,305,Michael,What if they made out? In front of everybody?,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,305,Toby,"Well, that would be...",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,305,Michael,At home? And I told everybody everything about it.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,305,Toby,"Okay, I'm lost.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,305,Michael,"Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,306,Michael,"I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey!

2,2,Sexual Harassment,306,Jim,"No, thanks. I'm good.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,306,Michael,That's what she said. Pam?,

2,2,Sexual Harassment,307,Toby,Sure.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,307,Dwight,"Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female v*g1n* look like?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,308,Toby,"Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,309,Toby,"Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,309,Dwight,Good. Good. And...,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,309,Toby,I should get back to work.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,309,Dwight,Okay.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,310,Man in Video,"In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves 'where is the line?'",

2,2,Sexual Harassment,313,Mr. O'Malley,I love lawyer jokes.,
2,2,Sexual Harassment,313,Michael,"Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,314,Michael,"When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,315,Jan,"You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,315,Michael,The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.,

2,2,Sexual Harassment,315,Michael,"Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.",

And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.",
2,2,Sexual Harassment,316,Jim,Does that include 'That's What She Said'?,

2,2,Sexual Harassment,322,Pam's Mom,"Oh, my goodness. That's great.",

2,3,Office Olympics,328,Michael,Ok.  Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.,
2,3,Office Olympics,329,Michael,"Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.",
2,3,Office Olympics,329,Dwight,Diversifying. Smart.,
2,3,Office Olympics,329,Michael,"Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.",
2,3,Office Olympics,329,Dwight,"And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.",
2,3,Office Olympics,329,Michael,Maybe.,
2,3,Office Olympics,330,Pam,"Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.",
2,3,Office Olympics,331,Pam,You see Dwight's coffee mug?,
2,3,Office Olympics,331,Jim,Mm-hmm.,
2,3,Office Olympics,331,Pam,"Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it.",
2,3,Office Olympics,331,Jim,No way. Let's do this  Oh.,
2,3,Office Olympics,331,Pam,Here.,
2,3,Office Olympics,331,Jim,Wind.,

2,3,Office Olympics,332,Michael,Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Dwight,Uh huh.,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Michael,Sign the papers at the condo.,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Dwight,You have your lawyer there?,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Michael,"Uh, I don't need one.",
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Dwight,Can I be your representative?,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Michael,I don't need a representative.,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Dwight,I think I should be there.,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Michael,"No, No.",
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Dwight,I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Michael,No. Dwight. I'm fine.,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Dwight,"Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.",
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Michael,"Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.",
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Dwight,So you're taking a personal day?,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Michael,"Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.",
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Dwight,"Please, I'll make you proud.",
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Michael,"Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.",
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Dwight,Yes! As your representative?,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Michael,As my associate.,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Dwight,Same thing.,
2,3,Office Olympics,332,Michael,No it is not.,
2,3,Office Olympics,333,Dwight,"I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.",
2,3,Office Olympics,334,Michael,"Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.",
2,3,Office Olympics,334,Pam,You headed out?,
2,3,Office Olympics,334,Michael,We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.,
2,3,Office Olympics,334,Pam,Ok.,
2,3,Office Olympics,334,Michael,Very good.,
2,3,Office Olympics,334,Pam,Have a great time.,
2,3,Office Olympics,334,Michael,"We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?",

2,3,Office Olympics,334,Pam,"Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.",
2,3,Office Olympics,334,Michael,"How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?",
2,3,Office Olympics,334,Michael,"NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked. Thank you.",
2,3,Office Olympics,334,Pam,Yeah.,
2,3,Office Olympics,334,Michael,Ok. See you soon.,
2,3,Office Olympics,335,Dwight,What kind of shocks you got on this baby?,
2,3,Office Olympics,335,Michael,"I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?",
2,3,Office Olympics,335,Dwight, I want to put the top down.,
2,3,Office Olympics,335,Michael,"What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please...",
2,3,Office Olympics,335,Dwight,But then no one can see us.,
2,3,Office Olympics,335,Michael,I... Just... Would you put it up?  Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.,
2,3,Office Olympics,335,Dwight,Check it out.  Terminator.,
2,3,Office Olympics,335,Michael,I do not understand what you spend your money on.,
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Kevin, Ooh.,
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Jim,"Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?",
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Oscar,"Yeah. It's a terrible system, I know.",
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Jim, What does 2005 season mean?,
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Oscar,Eh.,
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Jim,"Wait a minute, what is this?",
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Oscar,It's a scoreboard.,
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Jim,What?,
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Oscar,Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael's out.,
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Jim,Really?,
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Oscar,Yeah.,
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Kevin,Or when we're bored.,
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Jim,"Oh my God! Wait, this goes back two years.",
2,3,Office Olympics,336,Kevin,We're bored a lot.,
2,3,Office Olympics,337,Jim, OH!,
2,3,Office Olympics,337,Kevin,Oh!,
2,3,Office Olympics,337,Oscar,Sweet!,
2,3,Office Olympics,337,Jim,Yes! So close. I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game. Yeah.,
2,3,Office Olympics,337,Kevin,We call it Hate Ball.,
2,3,Office Olympics,337,Jim,Why?,
2,3,Office Olympics,337,Kevin,Because of how much Angela hates it.,
2,3,Office Olympics,337,Jim,"Hey, do you guys have any other games?",
2,3,Office Olympics,337,Kevin,"Sometimes we play ""Who can put the most M&M's in their mouth?""",
2,3,Office Olympics,337,Oscar,You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball.,
2,3,Office Olympics,338,Michael,"Home, sweet home.",
2,3,Office Olympics,338,Dwight,Which one's yours?,
2,3,Office Olympics,338,Michael,"Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait...  no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.",
2,3,Office Olympics,339,Jim, So that's what this sound is all day.,
2,3,Office Olympics,340,Carol,"Michael, this is Bill. He's the head of the condo association.",
2,3,Office Olympics,340,Michael,"Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.",
2,3,Office Olympics,340,Bill,Nice to meet you.,
2,3,Office Olympics,340,Michael,Nice to meet you too.,
2,3,Office Olympics,340,Dwight,This is smaller than your old place.,
2,3,Office Olympics,340,Michael,"Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.",
2,3,Office Olympics,341,Dwight,"Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for s*x.",
2,3,Office Olympics,342,Carol,Are we ready to sign some papers?,
2,3,Office Olympics,342,Dwight,"Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.",
2,3,Office Olympics,342,Bill,"It's very safe. It's very clean. Also, it's very accepting of all lifestyles.",
2,3,Office Olympics,342,Carol,It's a very gay-friendly neighborhood.,
2,3,Office Olympics,342,Michael,Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.,
2,3,Office Olympics,342,Dwight,Let's go check out the master bedroom.,
2,3,Office Olympics,343,Jim,"Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?",
2,3,Office Olympics,343,Stanley,"Yeah, I got a game. It's called ""work hard so my kids can go to college.""",
2,3,Office Olympics,343,Jim,Fair enough.,
2,3,Office Olympics,344,Michael,"This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness.  Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.",
2,3,Office Olympics,344,Dwight,Oh. Terrible idea.,
2,3,Office Olympics,344,Michael,I'm putting my bed right over here.,
2,3,Office Olympics,344,Dwight,"No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.",
2,3,Office Olympics,344,Michael,"Well, then I will get a warrantee.",
2,3,Office Olympics,344,Dwight,"Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.",
2,3,Office Olympics,344,Michael,Well then I won't get a warrantee.,
2,3,Office Olympics,344,Dwight,Shh Shh.,
2,3,Office Olympics,344,Michael,"So that's the problem, is solved. What?",
2,3,Office Olympics,344,Dwight,Listen.  Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.,
2,3,Office Olympics,345,Jim, This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.,
2,3,Office Olympics,345,Kevin,It smells like cookies.,
2,3,Office Olympics,345,Jim,"Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.",
2,3,Office Olympics,345,Pam,"Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.",
2,3,Office Olympics,346,Angela,I do play games. I sing and I dangle things in front of my cats. I play lots of games. Just not at work.,
2,3,Office Olympics,347,Jim,Let the games begin. ,
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Carol,"And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.",
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Dwight,What kind of mortgage did you get?,
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Michael,Uh... Ten year.,
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Carol,"Well, ten over thirty, so thirty year total.",
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Michael,What? Wha? You said ten.,
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Carol,"Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total.",
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Dwight,"Ho, thirty years.",
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Michael,"Ok, ok, ok.",
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Dwight,"Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.",
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Michael,Alright.,
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Dwight,"Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.",
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Michael,Ok. Alright. Oh boy.,
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Dwight,"Well, this is it.",
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Carol,Whenever you're ready.,
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Michael,"Um. Oh.  Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?",
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Carol,Actually yes.,
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Dwight,"Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.",
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Michael,Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.,
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Dwight,We'll be here waiting for you.,
2,3,Office Olympics,348,Michael,"Oh, man.",
2,3,Office Olympics,349,Dwight,"A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.",
2,3,Office Olympics,350,Carol,"Whenever you're ready, Michael.",
2,3,Office Olympics,350,Michael,Uh. ,
2,3,Office Olympics,351,Jim,"You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?",
2,3,Office Olympics,351,Pam,"Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton.",
2,3,Office Olympics,351,Jim,Hum.,
2,3,Office Olympics,351,Pam,"In English, box of paper snowshoe racing.",
2,3,Office Olympics,351,Jim,"Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.",
2,3,Office Olympics,352,Pam,"The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.",
2,3,Office Olympics,353,Jim,"So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?",
2,3,Office Olympics,353,Phyllis,I'll do it.,
2,3,Office Olympics,353,Jim,"Yes! Phyllis!  Phyllis, just put your foot right through here . Right through the flonk.",
2,3,Office Olympics,354,Michael,"The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't...",
2,3,Office Olympics,354,Carol,What?,
2,3,Office Olympics,354,Michael,...know if you showed me this same unit or not.,
2,3,Office Olympics,354,Carol,"Michael, this is the unit you saw and...",
2,3,Office Olympics,354,Michael,Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.,
2,3,Office Olympics,354,Carol,Who told you that?,
2,3,Office Olympics,354,Michael,"As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.",
2,3,Office Olympics,355,Michael,"There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.",
2,3,Office Olympics,356,Carol,"Is this a financial thing? If it's a financial thing, what some people do is they rent out the third bedroom.",
2,3,Office Olympics,356,Michael,"No, no, no.",
2,3,Office Olympics,356,Carol,That's some extra income for you.,
2,3,Office Olympics,356,Michael,I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.,
2,3,Office Olympics,356,Carol,"You will lose $7,000 if you walk away right now.",
2,3,Office Olympics,356,Michael,Ehhhh....,
2,3,Office Olympics,357,Michael,I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.,
2,3,Office Olympics,357,Dwight,Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? ,
2,3,Office Olympics,358,Jim,Here we go. Here we go.,
2,3,Office Olympics,358,Pam,Go! Go! Go!,

2,3,Office Olympics,359,Jim,Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.,
2,3,Office Olympics,360,Michael,"There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.",
2,3,Office Olympics,360,Dwight,You didn't have to...,
2,3,Office Olympics,360,Michael,"No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.",
2,3,Office Olympics,361,Michael,"Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.",
2,3,Office Olympics,362,Dwight,I don't even know what to say.,
2,3,Office Olympics,362,Michael,"I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.",
2,3,Office Olympics,362,Dwight,Question. Where can I put my terrarium?,
2,3,Office Olympics,362,Michael,What the hell is a terrarium?,
2,3,Office Olympics,362,Dwight,It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.,
2,3,Office Olympics,362,Michael,"Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.",
2,3,Office Olympics,362,Dwight,Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.,
2,3,Office Olympics,363,Pam,Are you sure you don't want to play?,
2,3,Office Olympics,363,Angela,I'm sure.,
2,3,Office Olympics,363,Pam,"Come on Angela, don't you have a game?",
2,3,Office Olympics,363,Angela,"I have one, yes.",
2,3,Office Olympics,363,Pam,"Well, let's play, what is it?",
2,3,Office Olympics,363,Angela,I call it Pam Pong. I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you.,
2,3,Office Olympics,363,Pam,We're friends.,
2,3,Office Olympics,363,Angela,Apparently.,
2,3,Office Olympics,363,Jim,"Very nicely done. I think that's H-O-R for Stanley, and H-O for Phyllis.",
2,3,Office Olympics,363,Phyllis,Are you calling me a ho?,
2,3,Office Olympics,363,Jim,"Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.",
2,3,Office Olympics,364,Dwight,"Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?",
2,3,Office Olympics,364,Michael,We take separate cars.,
2,3,Office Olympics,364,Dwight,Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?,
2,3,Office Olympics,364,Michael,Why would we do that?,
2,3,Office Olympics,364,Dwight,Just for fun?,
2,3,Office Olympics,364,Michael,No.,
2,3,Office Olympics,364,Dwight,Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?,
2,3,Office Olympics,364,Michael,"EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.",
2,3,Office Olympics,365,Dwight,"Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.",
2,3,Office Olympics,366,Oscar,Ah...,
2,3,Office Olympics,366,Everyone,OH!,
2,3,Office Olympics,366,Jim,Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?,

2,3,Office Olympics,367,Stanley,A little bit more and I would have had it.,
2,3,Office Olympics,368,Dwight,You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm. We paid it off early.,
2,3,Office Olympics,368,Michael,"Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.",
2,3,Office Olympics,368,Dwight,People love beets.,
2,3,Office Olympics,368,Michael,Nobody likes beets.,
2,3,Office Olympics,368,Dwight,Everybody loves beets.,
2,3,Office Olympics,368,Michael,"Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.",
2,3,Office Olympics,368,Dwight,Let's get this roof going.,
2,3,Office Olympics,368,Michael,Stop it! ,

2,3,Office Olympics,370,Jim, Here you go. All done.,
2,3,Office Olympics,370,Oscar,Great.,
2,3,Office Olympics,371,Jim,"Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.",
2,3,Office Olympics,372,Ryan,"I figured I could throw it away now, or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away. I mean, it was really nice of Pam to make them, but what am I going to do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid?",
2,3,Office Olympics,373,Jim,Hey.,
2,3,Office Olympics,373,Pam,I have 59 voicemails.,

2,5,Halloween,429,Michael,Ohh... OK.,

2,5,Halloween,430,Sherri, Jan Levinson's office.,
2,5,Halloween,430,Michael,"Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.",
2,5,Halloween,430,Sherri,"Oh, she's in a meeting. Uh, she just wanted the name of the employee you let go.",
2,5,Halloween,430,Michael,"Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.",
2,5,Halloween,430,Sherri,I just need the name of who you're planning to let go.,
2,5,Halloween,430,Michael,I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.,
2,5,Halloween,430,Sherri,I know she wanted the name.,
2,5,Halloween,430,Michael,Okay... Sherri?,
2,5,Halloween,430,Sherri,Yeah?,
2,5,Halloween,430,Michael,"If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?",
2,5,Halloween,430,Sherri,"Jan wants the name as soon as possible, Michael.",
2,5,Halloween,430,Michael,Thanks.,
2,5,Halloween,430,Sherri,Mm-Hmm.,

2,5,Halloween,430,Sherri,Hanging up now.,
2,5,Halloween,431,Michael,"I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.",
2,5,Halloween,431,Pam, You wanted me?,
2,5,Halloween,431,Michael,Yes.,
2,5,Halloween,431,Pam, Papier-mache?,
2,5,Halloween,431,Michael,Yes.,
2,5,Halloween,431,Pam,Hmm.,
2,5,Halloween,431,Michael,Yeeesh.,
2,5,Halloween,431,Pam,Mm-hmm.,
2,5,Halloween,431,Michael,"Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.",
2,5,Halloween,431,Pam,Why did you put it off until Halloween?,
2,5,Halloween,431,Michael,Because it's very scary stuff.,
2,5,Halloween,431,Pam,I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.,
2,5,Halloween,431,Michael,You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.,
2,5,Halloween,431,Pam,So it's a man?,
2,5,Halloween,431,Michael,"No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?",
2,5,Halloween,431,Pam,I just answer the phone.,
2,5,Halloween,431,Michael,And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.,
2,5,Halloween,431,Pam,You're costume is fantastic! ,
2,5,Halloween,431,Michael,I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. ,
2,5,Halloween,431,Pam,"Oh no, don't, don't, don't, don't.  Aah!  Okay...",
2,5,Halloween,431,Michael,"Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.",
2,5,Halloween,432,Dwight, What is that?! What are you supposed to be?,
2,5,Halloween,432,Jim,"I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.",
2,5,Halloween,432,Phyllis,That's great!,
2,5,Halloween,432,Jim,"Oh, yeah.",
2,5,Halloween,432,Dwight,"Yeah, well look...  What about me?",
2,5,Halloween,432,Phyllis,What are you? A monk?,
2,5,Halloween,432,Dwight,I am a Sith Lord.  Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.,
2,5,Halloween,432,Phyllis,Ass.,
2,5,Halloween,433,Michael,Hey.,
2,5,Halloween,433,Oscar,Michael.,
2,5,Halloween,433,Michael,You guys excited about the party?,
2,5,Halloween,433,Angela,Yeah.,

2,5,Halloween,433,Kevin,Yeah.,
2,5,Halloween,433,Angela,Yes.,
2,5,Halloween,433,Michael," Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.",
2,5,Halloween,433,Oscar,What are you implying?,
2,5,Halloween,433,Michael,All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?,
2,5,Halloween,433,Angela,"You know, I don't know. We put them all up last night.",
2,5,Halloween,433,Michael,"Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?",
2,5,Halloween,433,Angela,Yeah.,
2,5,Halloween,433,Michael,"Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.",
2,5,Halloween,433,Angela,But we don't keep two sets of books.,
2,5,Halloween,433,Michael,"Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.",
2,5,Halloween,434,Michael,"Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.",
2,5,Halloween,434,Kelly,Why is that?,
2,5,Halloween,434,Michael,"""Bend It Like Beckham.""",
2,5,Halloween,434,Kelly,"Oh, like ... the movie about the Indian girl who plays soccer?",
2,5,Halloween,434,Michael, Yeah. That would be perfect.,
2,5,Halloween,434,Kelly,"Yeah, I mean, I guess I could do that. I don't really play soccer or anything.",
2,5,Halloween,434,Michael,"Well, I don't really have two heads. So...",
2,5,Halloween,435,Dwight,"Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! ",
2,5,Halloween,436,Pam,"Okay, greatest strength.",
2,5,Halloween,436,Jim,"Okay, okay...",
2,5,Halloween,436,Pam,A dog-like obedience to authority,
2,5,Halloween,436,Jim,Nice.,
2,5,Halloween,436,Pam,But that doesn't sound good.,
2,5,Halloween,436,Jim,"Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? ",
2,5,Halloween,437,Jim,"Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.",
2,5,Halloween,438,Pam,He's a gun nut.,
2,5,Halloween,438,Jim,Um. He sticks to his guns.,
2,5,Halloween,439,Angela,"Well, I looked through all the budgets. And there is one department...",
2,5,Halloween,439,Oscar,Yes?,
2,5,Halloween,439,Angela,... that has three people...,
2,5,Halloween,439,Oscar,Yeah?,
2,5,Halloween,439,Angela,... doing the work that could be done by two.,
2,5,Halloween,439,Oscar,This is great.  Oh.,
2,5,Halloween,439,Kevin,Yeah. Oh.,
2,5,Halloween,440,Michael,Who do you think it should be?,
2,5,Halloween,440,Dwight,Jim. Definitely.,
2,5,Halloween,440,Michael,"No, Jim brings in money.",
2,5,Halloween,440,Dwight,Phyllis.,
2,5,Halloween,440,Michael,Eh.,
2,5,Halloween,440,Dwight,Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.,
2,5,Halloween,441,Michael,It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.,
2,5,Halloween,442,Dwight,One of the warehouse guys.,
2,5,Halloween,442,Michael, What? There was someone left off that list? Who?,
2,5,Halloween,442,Dwight,Who is he saying?,
2,5,Halloween,442,Michael,"You're right, I didn't even think of him.",
2,5,Halloween,442,Dwight,"No, Michael.",
2,5,Halloween,442,Michael,"Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.",
2,5,Halloween,442,Dwight,"No, not me.",
2,5,Halloween,442,Michael,Yeah... I could.,
2,5,Halloween,442,Dwight,Not Dwight.,
2,5,Halloween,442,Michael,I'm not saying that's what he said.,
2,5,Halloween,442,Dwight,I know that's what he said.,
2,5,Halloween,442,Michael, What?,
2,5,Halloween,442,Dwight,"Tell him, not Dwight.",
2,5,Halloween,442,Michael,That is not a very nice thing to say about him.,
2,5,Halloween,442,Dwight,Tell him to stop.,
2,5,Halloween,442,Michael,Are you kidding?,
2,5,Halloween,442,Dwight,"Quiet, you.",
2,5,Halloween,442,Michael,I agree. He'd land on his feet.,
2,5,Halloween,442,Dwight,Make him be quiet.,
2,5,Halloween,443,Angela,Those aren't chips and dip.,
2,5,Halloween,443,Pam,"No, I made brownies.",
2,5,Halloween,443,Angela,Uh!,
2,5,Halloween,443,Pam,... What?,
2,5,Halloween,443,Angela,I'm just trying to figure out why you're sabotaging things.,
2,5,Halloween,443,Pam,I made brownies.,
2,5,Halloween,443,Angela,And I made cookies. Same category.,
2,5,Halloween,444,Pam,I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.,
2,5,Halloween,445,Pam," Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam.  Uh, yeah.  Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.",
2,5,Halloween,446,Jim,"Um... Whoa.  Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.",
2,5,Halloween,447,Dwight,"Stanley, could you come with me, please.",
2,5,Halloween,447,Stanley,No.,
2,5,Halloween,447,Dwight,As Assistant Regional Manager...,
2,5,Halloween,447,Stanley,To the.,
2,5,Halloween,447,Dwight,"Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go.  I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry.",
2,5,Halloween,447,Stanley, You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.,
2,5,Halloween,448,Michael,So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?,
2,5,Halloween,448,Dwight,He wouldn't listen to me,
2,5,Halloween,448,Michael,"Ahh, come on.",
2,5,Halloween,448,Dwight,"If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.",
2,5,Halloween,448,Michael,"I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... ",
2,5,Halloween,449,Dwight," Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?",
2,5,Halloween,450,Dwight,"Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.",
2,5,Halloween,451,Oscar,Oh... hey.,
2,5,Halloween,451,Ryan,"Oh, your dress is stuck in the back. Kind of just...",
2,5,Halloween,451,Oscar,Oh. ,
2,5,Halloween,452,Dwight," So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... ",
2,5,Halloween,453,Pam,"Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real.",
2,5,Halloween,454,Pam,"Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.",
2,5,Halloween,454,Jim,Um... it's in Maryland.,
2,5,Halloween,454,Pam,"Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.",
2,5,Halloween,454,Jim,Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. ,
2,5,Halloween,454,Pam,Jim...,
2,5,Halloween,455,Dwight,"This is called leveraging an offer.  Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?",
2,5,Halloween,455,Michael,"Oh, God.",
2,5,Halloween,455,Dwight,"I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.",
2,5,Halloween,455,Michael,Fantastic!,
2,5,Halloween,455,Dwight,And I turned it down.,
2,5,Halloween,455,Michael,What?! That would've solved all my problems.,
2,5,Halloween,455,Dwight,Out of loyalty to this company...,
2,5,Halloween,455,Michael,"Oh, you idiot.",
2,5,Halloween,455,Dwight,... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.,
2,5,Halloween,455,Michael,"If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.",
2,5,Halloween,455,Dwight,But then you wouldn't have me here.,
2,5,Halloween,455,Michael,"Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?",
2,5,Halloween,455,Dwight,It's in Maryland.,
2,5,Halloween,455,Michael,You can call. Can you call 'em?,
2,5,Halloween,455,Dwight,I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.,
2,5,Halloween,455,Michael,Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.,
2,5,Halloween,456,Jim,"Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.",
2,5,Halloween,456,Michael, Can I speak to you a minute?,
2,5,Halloween,456,Jim,Um... yes.,
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,"Michael, I really didn't mean to...",
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,Help. Me.,
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,I'm sorry?,
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,"I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.",
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,"Oh, you want me to be you?",
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,Yes.,
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,Okay.,
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,"I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.",
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,"Oh, are you firing Creed?",
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,"No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.",
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,We should switch seats in order to...,
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,"Yes, that's a good idea.",
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,"Alright.  Excuse me. I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...",
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!,
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,Wow.,
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,"I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!",
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,That's an overreaction.,
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.,
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,"Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...",
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,I... this is Creed.,
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,Okay.,
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,"I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. ",
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,"Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.",
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,"And I'm very angry, and I want...",
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim, Michael Scott here.,
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.,
2,5,Halloween,457,Jim,"Toby? Mm hmm.  I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...",
2,5,Halloween,457,Michael,"Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just... yeah.",
2,5,Halloween,458,Pam,What happened?,
2,5,Halloween,458,Jim,It wasn't me.,
2,5,Halloween,458,Pam,Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...,
2,5,Halloween,458,Jim,"Yeah, I know.",
2,5,Halloween,459,Michael,"Uh, hey... Creed?",
2,5,Halloween,459,Creed,Huh?,
2,5,Halloween,459,Michael,Could I talk to you for a second?,
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,"You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.",
2,5,Halloween,460,Creed,What are you telling me?,
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.,
2,5,Halloween,460,Creed,"No, I don't. I wanna stay right here.",
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,"No, you wanna leave.",
2,5,Halloween,460,Creed,"No, I wanna stay here.",
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,Why... why are you making this so hard?,
2,5,Halloween,460,Creed,"Um, I think there's a misunderstanding, Michael.",
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,I think you're right.,
2,5,Halloween,460,Creed,Can I go?,
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,"No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.",
2,5,Halloween,460,Creed,Let's fight it.,
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,Hmm?,
2,5,Halloween,460,Creed,Let's call Jan and fight this thing together like the old days.,
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,What old days? What are you talking about?,
2,5,Halloween,460,Creed,Did you start the paperwork yet?,
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,"It's right here on the desk, yeah.",
2,5,Halloween,460,Creed,"You don't have to do this, Michael.",
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,"I can't, I can't...",
2,5,Halloween,460,Creed,Undo it!,
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,I can't change anything. This is the way...,
2,5,Halloween,460,Creed,"No, you have the power to undo it.",
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,"I don't... okay, just listen.",
2,5,Halloween,460,Creed,"Michael, undo it!",
2,5,Halloween,460,Michael,Don't...,
2,5,Halloween,461,Michael,"Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?",
2,5,Halloween,462,Michael,"I have to fire someone today, okay?",
2,5,Halloween,462,Creed,Fine. Fire someone else. Fire Devon. He's terrible. I am so much better at my job than Devon.,
2,5,Halloween,462,Michael,"Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.",
2,5,Halloween,462,Creed,"No, no, no, no, no, no. I will forget so fast. You will be my savior. You're they guy who gave me my life back. Thank you. I knew you'd see it my way Michael. God Bless you. You're a fine man.",
2,5,Halloween,462,Michael,Don't...,
2,5,Halloween,462,Creed,"Listen, you will not regret this either. Devon is terrible; No one's gonna miss him. Good, good, good.",
2,5,Halloween,463,Michael,"Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?",
2,5,Halloween,464,Devon,"Creed's an idiot, you know that.",
2,5,Halloween,464,Michael,"Well, he...",
2,5,Halloween,464,Devon,"No, no, no, no, no, no! You had it right the first time.",
2,5,Halloween,464,Michael,"Well, maybe I did.",
2,5,Halloween,464,Devon,"Exactly. You gotta go with your gut, man.",
2,5,Halloween,464,Michael,"Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.",
2,5,Halloween,464,Devon,That's why I'm being fired?,
2,5,Halloween,464,Michael,No.,
2,5,Halloween,464,Devon,So you might not look like an idiot?,

2,5,Halloween,466,Jim, Come on.,
2,5,Halloween,467,Jim,"That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.",
2,5,Halloween,468,Michael,"I love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J.

2,6,The Fight,473,Stanley,I don't want to stay until seven again this year.,
2,6,The Fight,473,Pam,I don't really have any control over that Stanley.,
2,6,The Fight,474,Pam,"Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm.",

2,6,The Fight,475,Michael,"Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.",
2,6,The Fight,475,Ryan,Updating emergency contacts.,
2,6,The Fight,475,Pam,"Well, is that really a priority?",
2,6,The Fight,475,Michael,"Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. ""Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority."" Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.",
2,6,The Fight,475,Ryan,Catch-22.,
2,6,The Fight,475,Michael,"Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?",

2,6,The Fight,479,Jim,"Ok, say please.",
2,6,The Fight,479,Dwight,No. That is not a toy.,

2,6,The Fight,479,Jim,"Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.",
2,6,The Fight,479,Dwight,Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.,
2,6,The Fight,480,Michael,"And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.",
2,6,The Fight,480,Pam,Could you practice on the forms?,

2,6,The Fight,481,Michael,So? I've beaten up black belts.,
2,6,The Fight,481,Jim,"Uh, how did you know they were black belts?",
2,6,The Fight,481,Michael,"They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.",
2,6,The Fight,482,Ryan,Is your wife still your contact?,

2,6,The Fight,483,Angela,Have you signed the expense reports yet?,
2,6,The Fight,483,Michael,"Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me.  Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.",
2,6,The Fight,483,Dwight,Argggg!,
2,6,The Fight,484,Michael,"I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here.

2,6,The Fight,485,Michael,Just hit me. You'll see.,

2,6,The Fight,485,Jim,Just have Dwight punch you.,

2,6,The Fight,485,Jim,You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?,
2,6,The Fight,485,Dwight,What belt are they?,
2,6,The Fight,485,Michael,"Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...",

2,6,The Fight,487,Michael,Yeah.  Thank you.,
2,6,The Fight,488,Dwight,I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.,
2,6,The Fight,489,Jim,"Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.",

2,6,The Fight,489,Michael,"I haven't signed them, ok?",
2,6,The Fight,489,Pam,"No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?",
2,6,The Fight,489,Michael,"Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.",
2,6,The Fight,489,Pam,He's a purple belt. That's really high.,
2,6,The Fight,489,Michael,"Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him.",
2,6,The Fight,489,Pam,"It's just out there, you...",

2,6,The Fight,489,Dwight,"In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.",
2,6,The Fight,489,Michael,"Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.",
2,6,The Fight,489,Dwight,"Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!",
2,6,The Fight,489,Michael,"Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.",
2,6,The Fight,489,Dwight,"No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.",
2,6,The Fight,489,Michael,Really?,
2,6,The Fight,489,Dwight,Yeah.,
2,6,The Fight,489,Michael,You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.,

2,6,The Fight,489,Michael,"I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.",
2,6,The Fight,490,Jim,"Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...",
2,6,The Fight,491,Michael,I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.,
2,6,The Fight,491,Ira,"Uh, no, it's not.",

2,6,The Fight,493,Ira,"Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright?",
2,6,The Fight,493,Dwight,"Yes, Sensei!",

2,6,The Fight,499,Michael,"I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.",
2,6,The Fight,500,Angela,This is illegal.,
2,6,The Fight,500,Stanley,I don't care.,
2,6,The Fight,501,Michael,I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?,
2,6,The Fight,501,Dwight,Of course.,
2,6,The Fight,501,Michael,And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.,
2,6,The Fight,501,Dwight,"Michael, I don't know...",
2,6,The Fight,501,Michael,"I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.",
2,6,The Fight,501,Dwight,I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.,
2,6,The Fight,501,Michael,"No, no, title change only.",
2,6,The Fight,501,Dwight,I'll have Pam send out a memo.,
2,6,The Fight,501,Michael,"No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.",
2,6,The Fight,501,Dwight,Just a formality.,
2,6,The Fight,501,Michael,Absolutely but not really.,
2,6,The Fight,501,Dwight,"Michael, I have so much to learn from you.",
2,6,The Fight,501,Michael,Yes you do.,
2,6,The Fight,501,Dwight,"Thank you, Sensei.",
2,6,The Fight,501,Michael,"And, ditto.",
2,6,The Fight,502,Michael,"I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.",
2,7,The Client,503,Ryan," Hey, have they left for the big meeting yet? I've got Michael's lucky tie.",
2,7,The Client,503,Jim,No. They're in the conference room.,

2,7,The Client,503,Ryan,"Yeah, who dry-cleans jeans?",
2,7,The Client,504,Pam,"Michael and his jeans. He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens. But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans. I know that's why he started casual Fridays.",
2,7,The Client,505,Pam, I'll take those. Thanks. ,
2,7,The Client,506,Jan,This is a projection of the county's needs...,

2,7,The Client,506,Jan,"Thirteen schools, uh, two hospitals...",
2,7,The Client,507,Jim,"So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal. It's Lackawanna County. Our whole county. And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch. And I could work here for years. And years.  Years.",
2,7,The Client,508,Jan,"So when we get to the Radisson, I'd like to, um-",
2,7,The Client,508,Michael,I changed it. To Chili's.,
2,7,The Client,508,Jan,Excuse me?,
2,7,The Client,508,Michael,"Radisson just gives out this vibe, ""Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson"". It's kind of snooty. So.",
2,7,The Client,508,Jan,"You had no right to do that, Michael.",
2,7,The Client,508,Michael,Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course. It's where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine.,
2,7,The Client,508,Jan,It said that.,
2,7,The Client,508,Michael,It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor.,
2,7,The Client,508,Jan,Alright. But you will let me run this meeting.,
2,7,The Client,508,Michael,"Uh huh, uh huh.  Power trip.",
2,7,The Client,508,Jan,What?,

2,7,The Client,509,Oscar,"Yeah. And she was asking me about stuff, line by line, while we were having dinner.",
2,7,The Client,509,Toby,That is unbelievable.,
2,7,The Client,509,Pam,What is going on?,
2,7,The Client,509,Jim,We are doing worst first dates.,
2,7,The Client,509,Pam,"Oh my God, I win! Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.",
2,7,The Client,509,Oscar,"Ok, that's a joke.",
2,7,The Client,509,Pam,"No, they had to come back for me.",
2,7,The Client,509,Jim,"Wait, when was this?",
2,7,The Client,509,Pam,Umm... it was not that long ago.,
2,7,The Client,509,Kelly,"Wait, not Roy. Say it's not your fiance. ",
2,7,The Client,510,Jim,"I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why. Interesting.",

2,7,The Client,511,Jan,Thank you.,
2,7,The Client,511,Michael," Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now.",
2,7,The Client,511,Jan,"Michael, shouldn't take more than an hour.",
2,7,The Client,511,Michael,Well...,
2,7,The Client,511,Jan,Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour?,
2,7,The Client,511,Michael,"No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not.  Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao.  Adios!",
2,7,The Client,512,Jan,So which way is Chili's?,
2,7,The Client,512,Michael,"Uh, I'll drive.",
2,7,The Client,512,Jan,"Oh, no, that's alright. I wanna leave straight from there.",
2,7,The Client,512,Michael,"It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?",

2,7,The Client,512,Michael,Dar de dar.,
2,7,The Client,512,Jan,Ok.,
2,7,The Client,513,Michael,"Jan Levinson-Gould. Jan is cold. If she was sitting across from you on a train and she wasn't moving, you might think she was dead.",
2,7,The Client,514,Michael,We should come up with a signal of some sort.,
2,7,The Client,514,Jan,Why would we need a signal?,
2,7,The Client,514,Michael,"Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-",
2,7,The Client,514,Jan,"What kinda trouble are you planning on getting in, Michael?",
2,7,The Client,514,Michael,"Well, I... it could be either of us.",
2,7,The Client,514,Jan,"You're gonna let me do the talking, we agreed on that.",
2,7,The Client,514,Michael,Yeees.,

2,7,The Client,518,Pam," Ok, you want me to read 'em?",
2,7,The Client,518,Michael,Yes.,
2,7,The Client,518,Pam,"Ok. Um, a fisherman is walking down Fifth Avenue walking an animal behind him-",

2,7,The Client,519,Pam,What is that?,
2,7,The Client,519,Jim,"Oh, those are drawings. In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head. And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn. Now we know what he looks like.",
2,7,The Client,520,Michael,"First guy says ""Well, I'm an astronaut, so I drive a Saturn"". And the second guy says, ""Well, I am a pimp, so I drive a cheap Escort"". And the third guy says ""I gotcha both beat, I'm a proctologist, so I drive a brown Probe"".",

2,7,The Client,525,Dwight,"Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk!",
2,7,The Client,526,Dwight,"Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of ""Oklahoma"" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good.",

2,7,The Client,529,Ryan,"I forget it, brutha.",
2,7,The Client,529,Dwight,"Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever. And you're disgusting, Dwigt.  Wait, who's Dwigt?",
2,7,The Client,530,Pam,"Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops.",
2,7,The Client,531,Dwight,D-W-I-G-H-T.,

2,7,The Client,535,Jim, Wow.,
2,7,The Client,535,Pam,For the bugs.,
2,7,The Client,535,Jim,"Nice. That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.",
2,7,The Client,535,Pam,Yes... nice! I can't remember the last time someone made me dinner.,
2,7,The Client,536,Christian,Right down the street?,
2,7,The Client,536,Michael,"Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges this county's up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.",
2,7,The Client,536,Christian,I know.,

2,7,The Client,540,Michael,"Morning, Pam. Hey.",
2,7,The Client,541,Michael,"No, nothing happened. I-I swear, nothing happened. What, I'm, totally being serious. A gentleman does not kiss and tell, and neither do I.  No, seriously, guys, I'm not, I don't want to go into it at all. It's off limits. Fine, I took her back to her hotel and we made out for a little while. It was great. I mean she told me about her divorce, we talked for about five hours, she fell asleep on my arm. So.",

2,7,The Client,542,Dwight,And she is your boss.,
2,7,The Client,542,Michael,"And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.  Jan, I defend your honor.  Is that all?",
2,7,The Client,543,Jim,Jan didn't come back for her car last night.,
2,7,The Client,543,Pam,What!?,

2,7,The Client,544,Michael,"I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR. My question: do I do it as the man? Does she do it as my superior? I don't know. That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship. It's, uh,  Excuse me. Hello? Hi! Just talking about you. The camera? No. Uh huh. How's traffic? I miss you. What. Ok. Well, if it was a mistake, it was a wonderful mistake. No.  Would you excuse me?  No, I did not intentionally get you drunk. Um hmm. No, no.  This is just a fight. This is just a first fight of many fights we're gonna have. Right. No. Wha-so-I don't understand, you wanna see other people. Only other people. Wh-why, ok, I think you're still a little bit drunk  Excuse me? Excuse me?!  I think you're, yes, why don't you just come back here, go to the hotel, have a few drinks and-no, no. I didn't slip you something!",
2,7,The Client,545,Jim,Some might even say that we had our first date last night.,
2,7,The Client,545,Pam,"Oh, really?",
2,7,The Client,545,Jim,Really.,
2,7,The Client,545,Pam,Why might some say that?,
2,7,The Client,545,Jim,"Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.",
2,7,The Client,545,Pam,Uh hmm.,
2,7,The Client,545,Jim,"Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie.  And there was dancing and fireworks. Pretty good date.",
2,7,The Client,545,Pam,We didn't dance.,
2,7,The Client,545,Jim,"You're right, we didn't dance. It was more like, swaying. But still romantic.",
2,7,The Client,545,Pam,Swaying isn't dancing.,
2,7,The Client,545,Jim,Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.,
2,7,The Client,545,Pam,I have some faxes to get out.,
2,7,The Client,545,Jim,"Oh, come on, Pam. I-",
2,7,The Client,546,Jim,"Ok, we didn't dance. I was totally joking anyway. I mean, it's not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiance. Right?",
2,8,Performance Review,547,Dwight, You should get one of these.,
2,8,Performance Review,547,Jim,No. Thank you.,
2,8,Performance Review,547,Dwight,Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.,
2,8,Performance Review,547,Jim,Done.,
2,8,Performance Review,547,Dwight,This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core.  Sorry.,
2,8,Performance Review,547,Jim,S'ok.,
2,8,Performance Review,547,Dwight,"Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable s*x.",
2,8,Performance Review,547,Jim,You're not having s*x.,
2,8,Performance Review,547,Dwight,"Plus, improves your reflexes  see, I would have caught that.",
2,8,Performance Review,547,Jim,"Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?",
2,8,Performance Review,547,Dwight,It's only twenty-five bucks.,
2,8,Performance Review,547,Jim,"Wow. Um, ok. ",
2,8,Performance Review,548,Michael,"Pam, could I see you in my office?",
2,8,Performance Review,549,Pam,"It's performance review day, company-wide. Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds. So, I don't really know what to expect.",
2,8,Performance Review,550,Michael,"Pam, you're trustworthy-",
2,8,Performance Review,550,Pam,Thank you.,
2,8,Performance Review,550,Michael,And a woman-,
2,8,Performance Review,550,Pam,"Oh, no.",
2,8,Performance Review,550,Michael,"And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.  ""Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon."" First impressions?",
2,8,Performance Review,550,Pam,"Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.",
2,8,Performance Review,551,Michael,"My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been  swack, divorced. Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing. We just sort of got caught up in the moment. The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager. Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason. It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue. Was not professional. Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is. But this was mutual.",
2,8,Performance Review,552,Michael," ""I guess I missed you."" I guess I missed you. So, she misses me?",
2,8,Performance Review,552,Pam,She missed you.,
2,8,Performance Review,552,Michael,"But then she goes on to say ""that will be our only topic of discussion"". That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.",
2,8,Performance Review,552,Pam,I have one idea of what it means.,
2,8,Performance Review,552,Michael,"Ok. Yeah, what, what?",
2,8,Performance Review,552,Pam,Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.,
2,8,Performance Review,552,Michael,"Ohhh, great. Well, now I'm in a terrible mood. Let's do your performance review-",
2,8,Performance Review,552,Pam,"Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.",
2,8,Performance Review,552,Michael,"Ah, why, that's great news? That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?",
2,8,Performance Review,552,Pam,"Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.",
2,8,Performance Review,552,Michael,"Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again.  ""Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you"".",
2,8,Performance Review,553,Dwight,"Oh, hey, listen, Jim. Here's a little tip for your performance review.",
2,8,Performance Review,553,Jim,Ok.,
2,8,Performance Review,553,Dwight,Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.,
2,8,Performance Review,553,Jim,We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.,
2,8,Performance Review,553,Dwight,"Oh, yes, we do.",
2,8,Performance Review,553,Jim,"No, we don't.",
2,8,Performance Review,553,Dwight,"Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.",
2,8,Performance Review,553,Jim,"Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.",
2,8,Performance Review,553,Dwight,"Uh, that is so stupid. What if he gives it to you?",
2,8,Performance Review,553,Jim,I win.,
2,8,Performance Review,553,Dwight,"Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid.",
2,8,Performance Review,553,Jim,"Wait, wait; one thing. Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?",
2,8,Performance Review,553,Dwight,"Uh, duh.",
2,8,Performance Review,553,Jim,Duh.,
2,8,Performance Review,554,Jim,Today is Thursday. But Dwight thinks that it's Friday. And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.,
2,8,Performance Review,555,Stanley,Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.,
2,8,Performance Review,555,Michael,Really?,
2,8,Performance Review,555,Stanley,"Oh, yes. Let's listen to it again. And this time, really listen to the pauses.",
2,8,Performance Review,555,Michael,"God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? Sorry.",
2,8,Performance Review,555,Stanley,"Oh, no, that's ok. I did learn it on the streets. On the ghetto, in fact.",
2,8,Performance Review,555,Michael,No kidding.,
2,8,Performance Review,556,Stanley,It's all about my bonus.,
2,8,Performance Review,557,Pam,Michael and Jan definitely made out.,
2,8,Performance Review,557,Jim,Ohh...,
2,8,Performance Review,557,Pam,Maybe more.,
2,8,Performance Review,557,Jim,"Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday. So, keep that goin'.",
2,8,Performance Review,557,Pam,"Oh, yea!",
2,8,Performance Review,558,Michael,"Good work, Stanley. Great performance review. Stanley in the house, everybody. Woo! Angela, your turn.",
2,8,Performance Review,559,Angela,I actually look forward to performance reviews. I did the youth beauty pageant circuit. And I enjoyed that quite a bit. I really enjoy being judged. I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.,
2,8,Performance Review,560,Pam,Michael?,
2,8,Performance Review,560,Michael,Yeah?,
2,8,Performance Review,560,Pam,Jan's on the phone for you.,
2,8,Performance Review,560,Michael,"Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.",
2,8,Performance Review,561,Michael,Interesting. Jan is calling me. Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all.  Yeah?,
2,8,Performance Review,561,Jan,Michael.,
2,8,Performance Review,561,Michael,Jan! To what do I owe this pleasure?,
2,8,Performance Review,561,Jan,I am returning your many calls.,
2,8,Performance Review,561,Michael,"Well, hello to you, too. Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.",
2,8,Performance Review,561,Jan,"No. No, we won't be discussing that, Michael. The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.",
2,8,Performance Review,561,Michael,"Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.",
2,8,Performance Review,561,Jan,"Uh, your review is anything but a formality, Michael.",
2,8,Performance Review,561,Michael,Oh.,
2,8,Performance Review,561,Jan,I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.,
2,8,Performance Review,561,Michael,Been thinking about you.,
2,8,Performance Review,561,Jan,"Ok, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.",
2,8,Performance Review,561,Michael,"Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-",
2,8,Performance Review,561,Jan,Michael.,
2,8,Performance Review,561,Michael,Yep.,
2,8,Performance Review,561,Jan,Are the cameras with you...,
2,8,Performance Review,561,Michael,No.,
2,8,Performance Review,561,Jan,...in your office?,
2,8,Performance Review,561,Michael,"They are not. Yes, they are.  That's my girlfriend.",
2,8,Performance Review,562,Kevin,I heard they made out and had s*x.,
2,8,Performance Review,562,Oscar,"No, they just made out. That's it.",
2,8,Performance Review,562,Angela,Don't talk about it. Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.,
2,8,Performance Review,562,Kevin,Romances?,
2,8,Performance Review,563,Michael,"Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do. I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas. Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down? In a folder? A ""Michael-idea"" folder?",
2,8,Performance Review,563,Pam,Sorry.,
2,8,Performance Review,563,Michael,That's unfortunate. How 'bout the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there.,
2,8,Performance Review,563,Pam,What suggestion box?,
2,8,Performance Review,563,Michael,"The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously? Maybe there's prizes?",
2,8,Performance Review,563,Pam,"Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.",
2,8,Performance Review,563,Michael,"Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them. Hello, everybody? Yeah, uh, attention, please. Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.",
2,8,Performance Review,563,Ryan,Don't you mean constructive criticism?,
2,8,Performance Review,563,Michael,What did I say?,
2,8,Performance Review,563,Kelly,"You said ""constructive complements""; that doesn't make any sense.",
2,8,Performance Review,563,Michael,"Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?",
2,8,Performance Review,564,Jim," Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...",
2,8,Performance Review,564,Dwight,Saturday.,
2,8,Performance Review,564,Jim," ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.",
2,8,Performance Review,565,Jan," We'll address this in the meeting then. Ok. Ok, bye-bye.  Could you please tell Michael that I'm here?",
2,8,Performance Review,565,Pam,Sure.,
2,8,Performance Review,565,Michael,"Hi, Jan. How are you?",
2,8,Performance Review,565,Jan,I'm good, how are you?
2,8,Performance Review,565,Michael,Good to see you.,
2,8,Performance Review,565,Jan,Nice to see you.,
2,8,Performance Review,565,Michael,"Ok.  Ok, why don't we just step into my office? We're gonna go in here.",
2,8,Performance Review,565,Jan,Can we please go in your office?,
2,8,Performance Review,565,Michael,"Yep, right after you. Apres-vous.  No calls.",
2,8,Performance Review,565,Kevin,Oooo.,
2,8,Performance Review,566,Michael,Alright .,
2,8,Performance Review,566,Jan,Thank you.,
2,8,Performance Review,566,Michael,It's nice to see you.,
2,8,Performance Review,566,Jan,"Nice to see you too, Michael.",
2,8,Performance Review,566,Michael,Really?,
2,8,Performance Review,566,Jan,Not like that.,
2,8,Performance Review,566,Michael,"Oh, well.",
2,8,Performance Review,566,Jan,"You know Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top. I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder-Mifflin business.",
2,8,Performance Review,566,Michael,Alright.,
2,8,Performance Review,566,Jan,Period.,
2,8,Performance Review,566,Michael,Yep.,
2,8,Performance Review,566,Jan,Do we understand each other.,
2,8,Performance Review,566,Michael,Absolutely.,
2,8,Performance Review,567,Michael,"I'm a little confused. 'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy. And then it's like all regret. Because ""Oh, I regret that."" But, ""Wait, I'm still gonna call you."" But, but, ""We're just gonna talk business. And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job."" But what were talking about when we first kissed? Business.",
2,8,Performance Review,568,Jan,So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then?,
2,8,Performance Review,568,Michael,"No, no, no, I finished all of that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am. But I do say thank ya ma'am. But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam. Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam. If it's consensual.  We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question?",
2,8,Performance Review,568,Jan,No.,
2,8,Performance Review,568,Michael,"This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise.",
2,8,Performance Review,568,Jan,Fine.,
2,8,Performance Review,568,Michael,Are you wearing a new perfume today?,
2,8,Performance Review,568,Jan,How is that a business question?,
2,8,Performance Review,568,Michael,"Well, you're wearing it at the office. And  it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy.",
2,8,Performance Review,568,Jan,"Please don't smell me, Michael.",
2,8,Performance Review,569,Pam,"Hey, Jim.",
2,8,Performance Review,569,Jim,"Hey, how's it goin'?",
2,8,Performance Review,569,Pam,"Oh my God, did you see ""The Apprentice"" last night?",
2,8,Performance Review,569,Jim,"Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?",
2,8,Performance Review,569,Pam,Can you believe who Trump fired?,
2,8,Performance Review,569,Jim,"No, that was unbelievable.",
2,8,Performance Review,569,Dwight,Who? Who was it? Who did he fire?,
2,8,Performance Review,569,Pam,You didn't see it?,
2,8,Performance Review,569,Dwight,"No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?",
2,8,Performance Review,570,Michael,"I don't understand-  Hold on. Sorry.  Yes, Pam.",
2,8,Performance Review,570,Pam,"Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.",
2,8,Performance Review,570,Michael,I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.,
2,8,Performance Review,570,Pam,You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.,
2,8,Performance Review,570,Michael,"I did not, not, not use those words.",
2,8,Performance Review,570,Jan,"Uh, I'd like to sit in on that meeting  is it happening right now?",
2,8,Performance Review,570,Michael,"No, it's in like ten minutes.",
2,8,Performance Review,570,Pam,Everyone's waiting in the conference room.,
2,8,Performance Review,570,Jan,Great. Very good.,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers. Alright. Number one: ""What should we do to prepare for Y2K?""",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Dwight,What should we do to prepare for Y2K?,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Kelly,I thought you read these every week.,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box.  That happens occasionally.",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Dwight,It happens occasionally.,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"And, um, one down. Next suggestion: ""we need better outreach for employees fighting depression"". Ok, alright, enough with the jokes. Nobody in here is suffering from depression.",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Jan,"That sounds serious, Michael.",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Dwight,Tom?,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,Tom. Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Phyllis,Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago.  Tom?  Pow.,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion.",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Dwight,Next suggestion.,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"Arrr, dooby dooby do. ""You need to do something about your B.O.""",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Dwight,You need to do something about your B.O.,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Toby,Aren't the suggestions meant for you?,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Creed,"Uh, Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying. You were inferring.",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. ""You need to do something about your coffee breath""-",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Dwight,You need-,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,Ok.,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Dwight,To do something about-,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Angela,Sometimes you talk to us real close.,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"Yeah, is that hard for you? Alright, well-",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Angela,"Well, when you have coffee breath-",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,I'll work on that-,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Angela,It's hard.,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Dwight,"Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Dwight,Next suggestion.,
2,8,Performance Review,571,Michael,"""Don't sl-"", ok, that's blank  Don't, just put it-",
2,8,Performance Review,571,Dwight,"""Don't sleep with your boss""? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?",
2,8,Performance Review,572,Jan,"I can't, I can't-",
2,8,Performance Review,572,Michael,I don't understand why you're so upset.,
2,8,Performance Review,572,Jan,Please sit down.,
2,8,Performance Review,572,Michael,Let me ask you-,
2,8,Performance Review,572,Jan,You're gonna sit here and I'm gonna go sit over there.,
2,8,Performance Review,572,Michael,"Ok, let me ask you this.",
2,8,Performance Review,572,Jan,"Please, sit yourself down.",
2,8,Performance Review,572,Michael,Let me ask you something.,
2,8,Performance Review,572,Jan,"What, Michael.",
2,8,Performance Review,572,Michael,Where did you get your outfit?,
2,8,Performance Review,573,Dwight, You are giving me this raise! I deserve this raise!  Yes!  Yes! Yes! Hiya! The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah! Yes! Why are you gonna give me this raise? Why? Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Jan,"Because nothing did, Michael. It, I'm not going to say anything more about it, and I would advise that you do the same",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,Look-,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Dwight,Michael?,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,Oh my God...,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Dwight,"I'm sorry, am I interrupting? Oh God; were you guys making out?",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Jan,"No, Dwight; come in.",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Dwight,Great.,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,What do you want Dwight?,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Dwight,I am ready for my performance review.,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,"Ok, great. Your performance has been adequate. You may leave; goodbye.",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Jan,"Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael?",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,"You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Dwight,"Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,Why on earth would we give you a raise?,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Dwight,"That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking. Let me bring up one word: dedication.  I have never been late. Also, I have never missed a day due to illness.  Even when I had walking pneumonia. I even come in on holidays.",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,You do? How do you get in?,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Dwight,I have a copy of your key.,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Jan,That's a serious offense!,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man's heart.,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Jan,"Oh! Michael, for God sakes!",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Dwight,I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,"Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Dwight,"For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,"That was deer!? Gross, oh!",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Dwight,You liked it!,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,"Oh, did not!",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Dwight,"Jan, have you ever had deer?",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Jan,No.,
2,8,Performance Review,574,Dwight,"It's a delicacy. And you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,"What do you say, Jan?",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Jan,"Ok! Here's what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about ten minutes.",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Michael,"Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.",
2,8,Performance Review,574,Jan," Thank you, Dwight.",
2,8,Performance Review,575,Jan,"Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.  Do you have a light?",
2,8,Performance Review,576,Dwight,"And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said ""Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of"".",
2,8,Performance Review,576,Michael,That's from Superman?,

2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,588,Stanley,I think I do.,
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,588,Michael,"The problem is that when people hear the term ""big brother"", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.",
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,589,Kevin,I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff.,

2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,592,Pam,Ummmm...,
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,593,Dwight,"I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.",
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,594,Michael,"Meredith has an E-vite from Jim. Barbeque at Jim's tonight. Tonight? Wonder where my e-vitation is. Click on guest list. Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed. Must be... . No.",

2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,595,Angela,Hmm...  Excuse me.,
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,595,Pam,Oh.,
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,596,Michael,"There's always a distance between a boss and the employees. It is just nature's rule. It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me. I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys. But maybe I need to be even approachabler.",
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,597,Kevin,That's pretty young.,
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,597,Pam,Yeah.,

2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,597,Michael,Yeah! They were the most fun. We always invited them.,
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,598,Jim,"It's true. I'm having a party. I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael. So three ingredients for a great party. And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody. Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  He is very real.",
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,599,Pam, What?  Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you!,
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,600,Dwight,Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-,

2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,614,Pam,"Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.",
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,615,Pam,"Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together, you know? Like people can just be friends. And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.",

2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,618,Michael,Shut up!,
2,9,E-Mail Surveillance,619,Michael,"Funny story: the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv. The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says ""Hey you're funny, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt.""  And that was an improv. Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.",

2,10,Christmas Party,621,Kevin," Well, sort of. Why did you get it so big?",
2,10,Christmas Party,621,Michael,"A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.",
2,10,Christmas Party,621,Kevin,But what are we going to do with this hacked off part?,
2,10,Christmas Party,621,Michael,"Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.",
2,10,Christmas Party,622,Jim,"So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two.  This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.",
2,10,Christmas Party,623,Angela,"Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?",
2,10,Christmas Party,623,Phyllis,"Yes, I got those cute little ones.  Do you think I should have gotten the big ones?",
2,10,Christmas Party,623,Angela,We'll see.,
2,10,Christmas Party,624,Ryan,Angela drafted me into the party planning committee. Her memo said that we need to prepare for every possible disaster. Which to me seems excessive.,
2,10,Christmas Party,625,Michael," Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho,  pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?",
2,10,Christmas Party,625,Angela,Fifty.,
2,10,Christmas Party,625,Michael,Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.,
2,10,Christmas Party,626,Michael,"It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.",
2,10,Christmas Party,627,Michael,"I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.",
2,10,Christmas Party,627,Pam,You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.,
2,10,Christmas Party,627,Michael,"Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.",
2,10,Christmas Party,628,Kevin & Oscar,"One, two, three. ",

2,10,Christmas Party,630,Michael,You wanna be Santa?,
2,10,Christmas Party,630,Darryl,Yeah.,
2,10,Christmas Party,630,Michael,Have you ever seen Santa?,
2,10,Christmas Party,630,Darryl,"Yeah, I've seen Santa.",
2,10,Christmas Party,630,Michael,Okay.,
2,10,Christmas Party,630,Darryl,Who cares?,
2,10,Christmas Party,630,Michael,"Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.",
2,10,Christmas Party,630,Dwight,"Michael, I would like to be the elf.",
2,10,Christmas Party,630,Michael,That makes sense because he has elfish features.,
2,10,Christmas Party,631,Dwight," Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.",
2,10,Christmas Party,632,Toby,I got Angela. She is into these posters of babies dressed as adults. I got her one of those. I felt kind of weird buying that.,
2,10,Christmas Party,633,Oscar,"I got Creed. And to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about Creed. I know his name's Creed. I know he works right over there. I think he's Irish and I .. I got him this shamrock keychain.",

2,10,Christmas Party,635,Jim,"Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.",
2,10,Christmas Party,635,Michael,I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.,
2,10,Christmas Party,635,Jim,Yeah?,
2,10,Christmas Party,635,Michael,I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.,
2,10,Christmas Party,635,Jim,"Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?",
2,10,Christmas Party,635,Michael,Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.,
2,10,Christmas Party,635,Jim,"That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..",
2,10,Christmas Party,635,Michael,It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.,

2,10,Christmas Party,636,Stanley,I know how to plug something in.,
2,10,Christmas Party,636,Dwight,I want to do it.,
2,10,Christmas Party,636,Michael,"All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?",

2,10,Christmas Party,636,Dwight,"Hey, I could get some flares from my car.",
2,10,Christmas Party,636,Michael,"No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.",
2,10,Christmas Party,637,Michael,"Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, ""Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.""",
2,10,Christmas Party,638,Dwight,"First present, Oscar.",
2,10,Christmas Party,638,Oscar, Shower radio. Neat.,
2,10,Christmas Party,638,Kelly,"Oh, good, that was from me.",

2,10,Christmas Party,638,Creed,That's from me.,
2,10,Christmas Party,638,Jim,Great. Where did you get it?,
2,10,Christmas Party,638,Creed,I don't know. It was so long ago.,
2,10,Christmas Party,639,Jim,"He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number  and then threw it in a bag.",
2,10,Christmas Party,640,Creed,Yep. That's exactly what happened.,
2,10,Christmas Party,641,Dwight,Pam.,
2,10,Christmas Party,641,Pam," Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.",
2,10,Christmas Party,641,Jim,There's a little more to it.,

2,10,Christmas Party,641,Ryan," Whoa, a video iPod.",
2,10,Christmas Party,641,Michael,"Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.",
2,10,Christmas Party,641,Ryan,Wasn't there a $20 limit on the gift? This is 400 bucks.,
2,10,Christmas Party,641,Michael,You don't know that.,
2,10,Christmas Party,641,Ryan,"Yeah, you left the price tag on.",
2,10,Christmas Party,641,Michael,I did?,
2,10,Christmas Party,641,Ryan,Yeah.,
2,10,Christmas Party,641,Michael,"What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?",

2,10,Christmas Party,641,Michael,"Oh hey, for me. What is in here?  Oh, come on.",
2,10,Christmas Party,641,Phyllis,I knitted it for you.,
2,10,Christmas Party,641,Michael,An oven mitt? Okay. ,
2,10,Christmas Party,642,Michael,"So Phyllis is basically saying, ""Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth."" I gave Ryan an iPod.",
2,10,Christmas Party,643,Kevin,Should we just keep opening up the presents?,
2,10,Christmas Party,643,Dwight,We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.,
2,10,Christmas Party,643,Michael,I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.,
2,10,Christmas Party,643,Jim,What is Yankee Swap?,
2,10,Christmas Party,643,Michael,"One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.",
2,10,Christmas Party,643,Jim,I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.,
2,10,Christmas Party,643,Pam,"Yeah, we call it White Elephant.",
2,10,Christmas Party,643,Michael,"Well, I call it fun!",
2,10,Christmas Party,643,Oscar,Why are we doing this?,
2,10,Christmas Party,643,Michael,Because it's better. Because it's more special.,
2,10,Christmas Party,643,Angela,It sounds mean.,
2,10,Christmas Party,643,Michael,"Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.",
2,10,Christmas Party,644,Angela,Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere. ,
2,10,Christmas Party,645,Michael,"Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.",
2,10,Christmas Party,645,Meredith,I'll take the teapot.,
2,10,Christmas Party,645,Jim,"Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.",
2,10,Christmas Party,645,Michael,"Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.",
2,10,Christmas Party,645,Pam,I'll take the iPod.,
2,10,Christmas Party,645,Ryan,And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?,
2,10,Christmas Party,645,Dwight,"Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.",
2,10,Christmas Party,645,Stanley, That was meant for Kelly.,
2,10,Christmas Party,645,Ryan,"Yeah, I figured.",
2,10,Christmas Party,645,Michael,I think this is going great.,
2,10,Christmas Party,646,Kelly, Yikes.,

2,10,Christmas Party,648,Dwight,It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.,

2,10,Christmas Party,648,Meredith,I'll take the oven mitt.,
2,10,Christmas Party,648,Michael,"Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.",
2,10,Christmas Party,649,Michael,"Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.",
2,10,Christmas Party,650,Michael," ""In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.""",
2,10,Christmas Party,650,Dwight,"You and me, Michael. Yes!",
2,10,Christmas Party,650,Michael,Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?,
2,10,Christmas Party,650,Dwight,I never said it was better than an iPod.,
2,10,Christmas Party,651,Dwight,"Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.",
2,10,Christmas Party,652,Dwight," Take that, Saddam!",
2,10,Christmas Party,653,Michael,Last gift. Kevin.,
2,10,Christmas Party,653,Kevin,I want the foot bath.,
2,10,Christmas Party,654,Kevin,"That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it.  Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.",
2,10,Christmas Party,655,Dwight,"Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.",
2,10,Christmas Party,655,Pam,I want the iPod.,
2,10,Christmas Party,655,Kelly,Damn it.,
2,10,Christmas Party,655,Jim,Sure you don't want the teapot?,
2,10,Christmas Party,655,Pam,"Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..",
2,10,Christmas Party,655,Jim,Right.,

2,10,Christmas Party,655,Jim,Got to be kidding me.,
2,10,Christmas Party,656,Dwight,Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.,
2,10,Christmas Party,657,Michael, What is she so upset about?,
2,10,Christmas Party,657,Pam,Maybe because you hated her present so much.,
2,10,Christmas Party,657,Michael,Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.,
2,10,Christmas Party,657,Jim,"Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.",
2,10,Christmas Party,657,Stanley,And you should have just bought a $20 gift like everyone else.,
2,10,Christmas Party,657,Michael,"Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!",
2,10,Christmas Party,657,Oscar,You got a bonus check?,
2,10,Christmas Party,657,Pam,How much?,
2,10,Christmas Party,657,Michael,"It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.",
2,10,Christmas Party,657,Stanley,"All right, I'm done now.",
2,10,Christmas Party,658,Michael,"Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame.",
2,10,Christmas Party,659,Liquor Store Clerk,It comes to $166.41.,
2,10,Christmas Party,659,Michael,"All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?",
2,10,Christmas Party,659,Liquor Store Clerk,"Fifteen bottles of vodka? Yeah, that should do it.",
2,10,Christmas Party,659,Michael,"Cool, cool. Box it up.",
2,10,Christmas Party,660,Jim,"I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?",

2,10,Christmas Party,660,Jim,"Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.",
2,10,Christmas Party,660,Jim,"Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?",
2,10,Christmas Party,660,Dwight,No. I want it. I'm going to use it.,
2,10,Christmas Party,660,Jim,You don't even drink tea.,
2,10,Christmas Party,660,Dwight,"True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..",
2,10,Christmas Party,660,JIm,Okay ..,

2,11,Booze Cruise,685,Michael,It's cheaper.,

2,11,Booze Cruise,687,Michael,"Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, ""Who is this smart little cookie?"" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,688,Michael,"I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,689,Michael,"Leader... ship. The word ""ship"" is hidden inside the word ""leadership,"" as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!",
2,11,Booze Cruise,690,Oscar,"Last year, Michael's theme was ""Bowl over the Competition!"" So guess where we went.",

2,11,Booze Cruise,691,Phyllis,What does the furnace do?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,691,Michael,"All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!",
2,11,Booze Cruise,691,Jim,I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,691,Michael,Titanic?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,691,Pam,I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,691,Michael,"No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!",

2,11,Booze Cruise,693,Phyllis,"Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,693,Michael,"No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,693,Darryl,What?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,693,Michael,"The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.",

2,11,Booze Cruise,695,Dwight,Cool.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,695,Captain Jack,"Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,695,Michael,"I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,695,Captain Jack,"I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship.  Hi, welcome aboard.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,695,Michael,Okay.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,696,Michael,"In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.",

2,11,Booze Cruise,698,Captain Jack,"Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack.",

2,11,Booze Cruise,698,Captain Jack,"They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,698,Michael,"But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,698,Captain Jack,"Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side.  Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here...",
2,11,Booze Cruise,698,Michael,I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...,
2,11,Booze Cruise,698,Captain Jack,"Okay, Michael, if you don't mind...",

2,11,Booze Cruise,700,Brenda,When are you going to start the presentation?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,700,Michael,"Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.",

2,11,Booze Cruise,701,Captain Jack,Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!,
2,11,Booze Cruise,702,Dwight,"I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,703,Captain Jack,"All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest!",
2,11,Booze Cruise,703,Michael,"But before that, I have to do my presentation.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,703,Captain Jack,Nope! Dance contest!,
2,11,Booze Cruise,703,Michael,"All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!",
2,11,Booze Cruise,704,Michael,Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,705,Dwight, What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,705,Angela,"Hey, come inside and talk to me.",

2,11,Booze Cruise,707,Pam,I'm cold.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,708,Captain Jack,"So, what's this presentation all about?",
2,11,Booze Cruise,708,Michael,"Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?",
2,11,Booze Cruise,708,Captain Jack,Women and children.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,708,Michael,"No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,708,Captain Jack,That's a stupid analogy.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,708,Michael,"Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,708,Captain Jack,"Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,708,Dwight,Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,708,Michael,Okay.,

2,11,Booze Cruise,709,Katy,I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,709,Pam,"Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,710,Captain Jack,"Suppose your office building's on fire. Jim, who would you save?",
2,11,Booze Cruise,710,Jim,"Um... let's see, uh... The customer. Because the customer is king.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,710,Michael,"Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,710,Captain Jack,He's just sucking up!,
2,11,Booze Cruise,710,Roy,"When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?",
2,11,Booze Cruise,710,Captain Jack,"Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,711,Jim,You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,712,Roy,"Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!",
2,11,Booze Cruise,713,Michael,"I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?",
2,11,Booze Cruise,713,Roy,"No, it was Captain Jack.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,713,Michael,"Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great!",
2,11,Booze Cruise,713,Captain Jack,"We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!",
2,11,Booze Cruise,713,Michael,Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!,
2,11,Booze Cruise,713,Pam,"No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,713,Michael,Then I'll give you away!,
2,11,Booze Cruise,713,Pam,"No, thank you.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,714,Katy,Do you think that'll ever be us?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,714,Jim,No.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,714,Katy,What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,714,Jim,I don't know. Let's break up.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,714,Katy,Whoa. What?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,715,Captain Jack,This is where Captain Jack drives the boat.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,715,Meredith,Wow!,
2,11,Booze Cruise,716,Dwight,Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,716,Michael,Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,716,Brenda,Really? What?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,716,Michael,"Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...",
2,11,Booze Cruise,716,Captain Jack,Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,716,Michael,"It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,717,Michael,"I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Michael,Is somebody there?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Jim,What happened to you?,
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Michael,Captain Jack has a problem with authority.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Jim,"Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?",
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Michael,"He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Jim,What a night.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Michael,"Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Jim,She was always engaged.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Michael,Roy said the first one didn't count.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Jim,"That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...",
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Michael,"Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...",
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Jim,"Yeah, I know.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Michael,"Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Jim,"Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Michael,"Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Jim,She's engaged.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Michael,BFD. Engaged ain't married.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Jim,Huh.,
2,11,Booze Cruise,718,Michael,"Never, ever, ever give up.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,719,Dwight,"Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.",
2,11,Booze Cruise,719,Michael,"It's a fake wheel, dummy.",
2,12,The Injury,720,Oscar,"...Lord of the Rings trilogy, if you see it back to back, it's really long. But it's good.",
2,12,The Injury,720,Jim," Yeah, that's right.",

2,12,The Injury,721,Michael,"OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.",
2,12,The Injury,722,Michael,"I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.",
2,12,The Injury,723,Michael,"Pam, could you come get me?!",
2,12,The Injury,723,Pam,"Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.",

2,12,The Injury,723,Michael, No one wants to pick me up!?,

2,12,The Injury,723,Jim and Pam,Oh my God!,
2,12,The Injury,723,Pam,Is he ok?,
2,12,The Injury,723,Jim,"He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!",
2,12,The Injury,723,Michael,Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!,
2,12,The Injury,724,Michael,"Morning everyone. Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out. Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing. I just want to be treated normally today. Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.",
2,12,The Injury,724,Pam,"You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.",
2,12,The Injury,724,Michael,Did you explain why?,

2,12,The Injury,726,Michael,"No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God!",
2,12,The Injury,726,Dwight, It slipped.,
2,12,The Injury,726,Michael,What?,
2,12,The Injury,726,Dwight,Sorry.,
2,12,The Injury,726,Pam,"It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.",
2,12,The Injury,726,Michael,"I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask.",
2,12,The Injury,726,Pam,"Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.",
2,12,The Injury,726,Michael,"No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.",

2,12,The Injury,739,Billy Merchant,"So, there are just a couple things I want to remind everybody of...",
2,12,The Injury,739,Michael,Ok...,
2,12,The Injury,739,Billy Merchant,"First is parking. You can't block the freight entrance with your car, even if your blinkers are on. Does anybody have any questions?  Yes. Yeah? yes...",
2,12,The Injury,739,Pam,"Dwight, you have your hand up.",
2,12,The Injury,739,Michael,"Ignore him. You know what? We're not that different, you and I. When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...",

2,12,The Injury,740,Michael,Did you see Born on the Fourth of July? I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.,
2,12,The Injury,741,Billy Merchant,What's wrong with that guy?,
2,12,The Injury,741,Jim,You mean today? He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.,
2,12,The Injury,741,Billy Merchant,"No, not Michael. The moon-faced kid who crashed into the pole. He looks like he has a concussion.",
2,12,The Injury,742,Michael, Hey!,
2,12,The Injury,742,Ryan,I found the pudding cups you wanted in a gas station in Carbondale!,
2,12,The Injury,742,Michael,"You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan.",
2,12,The Injury,742,Ryan,You are very welcome.,
2,12,The Injury,742,Michael,Did you get the yams?,
2,12,The Injury,742,Ryan,"No, the gas station in Carbondale did not have fresh yams!",

2,12,The Injury,742,Ryan,You sure?,
2,12,The Injury,742,Michael,Yeh.,
2,12,The Injury,742,Ryan,Ok.,

2,12,The Injury,744,Michael,"Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better. My body's literally healing itself. It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.",
2,12,The Injury,745,Ryan,I ground up four extra-strength aspirin and put them in Michael's pudding. I do the same thing with my dog to get him to take his heartworm medicine.,
2,12,The Injury,746,Michael,"Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.",
2,12,The Injury,746,Dwight," Uh, ugh, ohhhh...",

2,12,The Injury,746,Michael,"Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.",
2,12,The Injury,746,Angela,"He needs to go right now, and you're his emergency contact. I think that you should go with him.",
2,12,The Injury,746,Michael,Why don't you go with him?,
2,12,The Injury,746,Angela,"I, barely know him...",
2,12,The Injury,746,Dwight,I want Michael to take me...,
2,12,The Injury,746,Michael,"I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.",
2,12,The Injury,746,Meredith,You can take my van!,
2,12,The Injury,746,Michael,"Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. Jim why don't you drive.",

2,12,The Injury,746,Dwight,It smells like chicken soup.,
2,12,The Injury,746,Pam,I know.,
2,12,The Injury,746,Dwight,I have to go to the hospital.,

2,12,The Injury,747,Michael,Shotgun!,
2,12,The Injury,747,Jim,You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?,
2,12,The Injury,748,Michael,"The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear. The first person to shout ""shotgun"" when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat. That's how the game's played. There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.",
2,12,The Injury,749,Michael,"Oh, God, a mini-van. What is Meredith's problem?",
2,12,The Injury,749,Jim,"Well, I think she has a kid.",
2,12,The Injury,749,Michael,"Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.",

2,12,The Injury,751,Dwight,Danger.,
2,12,The Injury,751,Michael," Something with a ""K"".",
2,12,The Injury,751,Jim,"It's Kurt. Wow, I am so sad that I know that.",
2,12,The Injury,751,Michael,"What do I write under ""reason for visit""?",
2,12,The Injury,751,Jim,Concussion.  What did you write?,
2,12,The Injury,751,Michael,"Nothing. I wrote ""bringing someone to the hospital"".",
2,12,The Injury,751,Jim,So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.,
2,12,The Injury,751,Michael,"No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. ",
2,12,The Injury,751,Jim,Come on Dwight. ,

2,12,The Injury,751,Michael,Hi Dwight.,
2,12,The Injury,752,Dwight,Ahhh. Mweehaa,

2,12,The Injury,752,Doctor,A head injury.,
2,12,The Injury,752,Michael,"Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.",
2,12,The Injury,752,Doctor," So, I'm ordering a CAT scan.",
2,12,The Injury,752,Dwight,What is that?,
2,12,The Injury,752,Michael,"Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?",
2,12,The Injury,752,Doctor,"Well, for a burn, you really just need to look at the outside of the foot.",
2,12,The Injury,752,Michael,"Ok, what kinda machine is that?",
2,12,The Injury,752,Doctor,Does the skin look red and swollen?,
2,12,The Injury,752,Dwight,That's what she said.,
2,12,The Injury,752,Michael,"That's my joke, damnit Dwight.",
2,12,The Injury,753,Lab Tech,"Ok, no electronics past this point. Camera, sound equipment...",
2,12,The Injury,753,Michael,"It's ok, they're with me.",

2,12,The Injury,754,Jim,"Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.",
2,12,The Injury,754,Pam,I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.,
2,12,The Injury,754,Jim,Michael went in there with him too. It's pretty sweet.,
2,12,The Injury,754,Pam,Really? Michael went in with him?,
2,12,The Injury,754,Jim,Uh huh.,

2,12,The Injury,755,Oscar,Ok...,
2,12,The Injury,755,Pam,"I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.",
2,12,The Injury,756,Lab Tech,"Ok Mr. Schrute, inhale with me on three. One, two, uh Sir?  Stop that. Stop. Stop that.",
2,13,The Secret,757,Jim,Not much what's up with you?,

2,13,The Secret,765,Dwight,Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.,

2,13,The Secret,765,Dwight,Question? May I investigate?,
2,13,The Secret,765,Michael,Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.,

2,13,The Secret,766,Michael,"Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time. It's much sexier.   Man, this must be torture for you.",
2,13,The Secret,767,Jim,Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.,
2,13,The Secret,768,Jim,Hey Michael.,
2,13,The Secret,768,Michael,Hey Jim-bag.,
2,13,The Secret,768,Jim,Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.,

2,13,The Secret,768,Michael,Wow!,
2,13,The Secret,769,Michael,"Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship. And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.",
2,13,The Secret,770,Michael,My lips are sealed.  My lips are sealed... Bangles.,
2,13,The Secret,770,Jim,Alright. Great. Thank you.,

2,13,The Secret,771,Dwight,Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it?,

2,13,The Secret,773,Dwight,"Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.",
2,13,The Secret,774,Dwight,"There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.",
2,13,The Secret,775,Michael,It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.,
2,13,The Secret,775,Jim,Tony the tiger. You don't hear that much any more.,
2,13,The Secret,775,Michael,Not so much.,
2,13,The Secret,775,Dwight,"Ok, what is going on here?",
2,13,The Secret,775,Michael,Nothing.,
2,13,The Secret,775,Dwight,"Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda. Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.",
2,13,The Secret,775,Michael,Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.,
2,13,The Secret,775,Dwight,Ok. So what is the secret Michael?,
2,13,The Secret,775,Jim,"Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.",
2,13,The Secret,775,Dwight,Is that true?,
2,13,The Secret,775,Michael,"Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.",
2,13,The Secret,775,Dwight,Thank you Michael. I know your telling the truth.,
2,13,The Secret,775,Michael,Ok.,
2,13,The Secret,775,Dwight,I can tell. I won't let you down.,
2,13,The Secret,775,Michael,Good.,
2,13,The Secret,775,Jim,Thanks.,

2,13,The Secret,784,Toby,You just got your corporate credit card back. Do you really want me to take it away again?,
2,13,The Secret,785,Michael,"Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?",

2,13,The Secret,786,Toby,I'm not processing this.,

2,13,The Secret,789,Dwight,"As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years. One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six straight nights. Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.",
2,13,The Secret,790,Kelly,"Jim, why didn't you tell me you had a crush on Pam?",

2,13,The Secret,792,Pam,Oh.,
2,13,The Secret,792,Jim,"Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.",
2,13,The Secret,792,Pam,Right.,
2,13,The Secret,792,Jim,"And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.",

2,13,The Secret,793,Oscar,Are you going to tell Michael?,
2,13,The Secret,793,Dwight,How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.,
2,13,The Secret,794,Dwight,"Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.",
2,13,The Secret,795,Jim,Hey.,
2,13,The Secret,795,Michael,"I know, I know, I know.",

2,13,The Secret,799,Michael,"People are always coming to me. ""Michael, I have a secret. Your the only one I trust."" No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend. This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.",

What a jerk. He's... You know what? I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.",
2,14,The Carpet,817,Kelly," I'm serious. My closet doors will not shut. I mean, it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up because aren't all hangers like that big? So I don't understand why the closet engineer didn't think of that. So now I'm doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor and then I walk around the piles to get an outfit...",
2,14,The Carpet,818,Michael,You know who used to sit at that desk?,

2,14,The Carpet,820,Michael,"Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute. Guy had no sense of humor about it. Probably why he wasn't hired.",

2,14,The Carpet,826,Oscar,"What happened in Michael's office was wrong. I understand it , it makes sense  But it... it was still wrong.",
2,14,The Carpet,827,Michael,"Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet? I don't know. It could be done out of hate. It could be done out of love. It could be completely neutral. Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady. And, well, she doesn't do a very good job, obviously, because my office still reeks like you would not believe. I hate her.",
2,14,The Carpet,828,Michael,You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense.,
2,14,The Carpet,829,Dwight," Hello, am I the 107th caller?  Hello, Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller?  Hell , Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller?  I'm totally gonna win us that box set.",
2,14,The Carpet,829,Michael,Stop.,
2,14,The Carpet,829,Dwight,Jethro Tull...,
2,14,The Carpet,829,Michael,Stop it.  Stop. It.  Don't. Don't.,
2,14,The Carpet,829,Dwight,I need to make a sales call. Please?,
2,14,The Carpet,829,Michael,All right.,
2,14,The Carpet,829,Dwight, Am I the 107th caller?,
2,14,The Carpet,830,Pam, ...back so soon.,
2,14,The Carpet,830,Roy,"We can go back in, like, a couple of weeks maybe.",
2,14,The Carpet,830,Pam,"Yeah, right.",
2,14,The Carpet,830,Roy,"Okay, maybe another month, like, maybe for, like President's Day or something.",
2,14,The Carpet,830,Pam,"Yeah, that's right. We could do a three-day weekend. I wonder if I could, like, call in sick on the Friday. Then I get a four-day weekend.",
2,14,The Carpet,831,Kelly," But it's so weird to fall asleep. And I just hate it. 'Cause I try to go to bed at, like, 9:30.",
2,14,The Carpet,832,Pam, Are you kidding?,
2,14,The Carpet,832,Roy,No.,
2,14,The Carpet,833,Michael,"Hi, guys.",
2,14,The Carpet,833,Angela,We haven't finished getting things in order from your last visit.,
2,14,The Carpet,833,Michael,I'm just walking around.,
2,14,The Carpet,833,Angela,Were you?,
2,14,The Carpet,833,Michael,"Well, yeah.",
2,14,The Carpet,833,Oscar,"It's just that we're really swamped over here, Michael.",
2,14,The Carpet,833,Michael,"Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good?",
2,14,The Carpet,833,Dwight,Yeah!,
2,14,The Carpet,833,Michael," Seventy, eighty, one, two three. Eighty-three dollars. Still a lotta money and I'm going to ...  ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest. Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?",
2,14,The Carpet,833,Phyllis,You're gonna compete against us?,
2,14,The Carpet,833,Michael,"Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!",
2,14,The Carpet,833,Dwight,It is so on!,
2,14,The Carpet,833,Michael,"God, this is gonna be fun.",
2,14,The Carpet,833,Dwight,Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!,
2,14,The Carpet,834,Michael," So you have 40 boxes going out, and I will deliver those personally in a Sebring. Very good, nice doing business with you. Thank you.  Yes!  Oh, yeah! Read it and weep. Oh! Oh, look at that!  Look at me, Phyllis! Oh, what is that? That's my sale! ",
2,14,The Carpet,834,Darryl, What... What's that? Whatcha doing?,
2,14,The Carpet,834,Michael, Nothing.,
2,14,The Carpet,834,Roy, I think he's dancing.,
2,14,The Carpet,834,Michael,No. Just ...,
2,14,The Carpet,834,Darryl,That was definitely not dancing.,
2,14,The Carpet,834,Michael,"You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just...",
2,14,The Carpet,834,Darryl,Paper business.,
2,14,The Carpet,834,Michael,"Yeah, paper business. Is this done?",
2,14,The Carpet,834,Roy,Nope.,
2,14,The Carpet,834,Michael,"Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that. ",
2,14,The Carpet,835,Pam,Somebody did something bad to Michael's carpet. Maybe that's all we need to know.,
2,14,The Carpet,836,Creed, Who do you think did it?,
2,14,The Carpet,836,Oscar,Are you kidding? I thought it was you.,
2,14,The Carpet,836,Creed,Really? I thought you. ,
2,14,The Carpet,837,Michael,This was no act of God. A person did this. A person who works in this office. Maybe all of them.,
2,14,The Carpet,838,Michael,You know what? Today is not a good day for a sales contest. We're... we're not... we're not doin' this today.,
2,14,The Carpet,838,Pam,That doesn't seem fair.,
2,14,The Carpet,838,Michael,"You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.",
2,14,The Carpet,838,Dwight,But you're the one who picked today.,
2,14,The Carpet,838,Michael,I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.,
2,14,The Carpet,838,Stanley,That's not what a hate crime is.,
2,14,The Carpet,838,Michael,"Well I hated it! A lot! Okay, I... you know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done .  Very well. Then you are all punished.",
2,14,The Carpet,838,Pam,What's our punishment?,
2,14,The Carpet,838,Michael,You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly.  No. NO! ,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Jim,Hey!,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Ryan,What's up?,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Jim,Nothing much. Let me ask you something. It's actually little awkward.,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Ryan,What?,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Jim,What do you think of Kelly?,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Ryan,I don't know. Depends if you like a little junk in ...  Umm... She's really cool.,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Jim,Are you interested in her?,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Ryan,"Yeah, totally.",
2,14,The Carpet,839,Jim,Really?,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Ryan,Did she say something?,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Jim,She said lots of things.,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Ryan,Do you know if she's looking for a long-term thing or if she'd be cool just hangin' out?,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Jim,I have no idea.,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Ryan,Can you find out?,
2,14,The Carpet,839,Jim,Yeah. Sure.,
2,14,The Carpet,840,Kelly," Oh, long-term, definitely. Fall in love, have babies, spend every second together... but don't tell him that, okay? Just tell him I'm, like, up for anything. I mean, I'm not a slut, but who knows?",
2,14,The Carpet,841,Michael,Do you remember Ed Truck?,
2,14,The Carpet,841,Creed,Sure. He hired me. How's he doing?,
2,14,The Carpet,841,Michael,How would I know?,
2,14,The Carpet,841,Creed,I thought you might.,
2,14,The Carpet,841,Michael,My biggest fear is turning into him.,
2,14,The Carpet,841,Creed,"Michael, you should have much bigger fears than that.",
2,14,The Carpet,841,Michael," I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you?",
2,14,The Carpet,842,Michael, Ed? Hi. Thanks for meeting me. Must be kinda neat comin' back.,
2,14,The Carpet,842,Ed,Yeah. Should we go upstairs?,
2,14,The Carpet,842,Michael,"Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now.",
2,14,The Carpet,842,Ed,"So, what's the problem with my pension?",
2,14,The Carpet,842,Michael,"Oh, no, no, no. You're good. It was clerical. You're good. Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.",
2,14,The Carpet,842,Ed,"Well, what was done?",
2,14,The Carpet,842,Michael,"I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.",
2,14,The Carpet,842,Ed,"Yeah, somebody once did that in my office.",
2,14,The Carpet,842,Michael,Really?,
2,14,The Carpet,842,Ed,Yeah.,
2,14,The Carpet,842,Michael,"Well, that figures. So how did you deal with people not liking you?",
2,14,The Carpet,842,Ed,You can't expect to be friends with everybody.,
2,14,The Carpet,842,Michael,Well... s-sure I can.,
2,14,The Carpet,842,Ed,No. They'll always think of you as a boss first.,
2,14,The Carpet,842,Michael,Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father.,
2,14,The Carpet,842,Ed,I'm not sure that ever happens.,
2,14,The Carpet,842,Michael,"Well, okay. Different management styles.",
2,14,The Carpet,842,Ed,"Why can't your workers be your workers, family be your family, your friends be your friends?",
2,14,The Carpet,843,Michael,"Last week I would have given a kidney to anyone in this office. I would have reached right into my stomach and pulled it out for them. But now, no. I don't have the relationship with these people that I thought I did. I hope they ask, so they can hear me say, ""Uh... no. I only give my organs to my real friends. Go get yourself a monkey kidney.""",
2,14,The Carpet,844,Jim," Hey, Brenda. This is, uh, Jim Halpert from the boat. And I got your number from the corporate directory and, well, I was assuming that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out, right? Um, so gimme a call back. You can get my number from said directory, um, or just check your e-mail 'cause I just sent you one. Yikes. Uh... give me a call back, I hope. I'll talk to you later. Bye.",
2,14,The Carpet,844,Kelly,You just asked a girl out on the phone!,
2,14,The Carpet,844,Jim,Yep.,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Michael, Yes.,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Todd Packer,"Hello, yes. I'm looking for a gay nerd named Michael Scott.",
2,14,The Carpet,845,Michael,Who is this? How did you get this number?,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Packer,"Your mom, you gay nerd!",
2,14,The Carpet,845,Michael,Oh my God. Packer. Packster. Whacky Pack. How you doin'?,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Todd,"Hey, did you get that package I left for you?",
2,14,The Carpet,845,Michael,Uh... no. Did anybody see a package here today? No. How big was it?,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Packer,It was pretty big.,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Michael,Really?,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Packer,Yeah.,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Michael,Did you see a big package? Where did you leave it?,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Packer,Left it in the middle of your office.,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Michael,"Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office?",
2,14,The Carpet,845,Roy,You mean the thing?,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Michael,Are you kidding me? Oh!,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Packer,Special delivery!,
2,14,The Carpet,845,Michael,"That was Packer! Oh, you're... you are dead. You are dead, my friend! That is hilar... Oh, God! Of course it was you.",
2,14,The Carpet,845,Packer,"Sit on the throne, Michael.",
2,14,The Carpet,845,Michael,"Oh.  Yeah, yeah! Oh my God. It was Packer!",
2,14,The Carpet,846,Michael,"It takes an advanced sense of humor. I don't expect everybody to understand. It was done out of love, just like I thought. It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people. We have fun.  We just have fun! Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out.",
2,14,The Carpet,847,Jim's voicemail,You have seven unheard messages.,
2,14,The Carpet,847,Pam," Hey, Jim. It's Pam. I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible. Anyway, I'm bored. Come back!",
2,14,The Carpet,848,Pam," Hey, guess what? I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head. It's working. I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.",
2,14,The Carpet,849,Pam," Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.",
2,14,The Carpet,850,Pam," I'll transfer you. Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold, please. Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry. Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you.",
2,14,The Carpet,851,Pam," Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe? Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.",
2,14,The Carpet,852,Pam," Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow.",
2,14,The Carpet,853,Pam," Calling from my cell phone. I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy. Everybody in the office. We need to talk.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,854,Jan,"So, I'm happy to be here. It's very nice to see all of you. You're all looking well.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,855,Pam,Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Jan,"Women today, though we have the same options as men, we often face a very different set of obstacles in getting there. So...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Michael," Hey, what's going on?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Jan,Michael... I thought we agreed you wouldn't be here.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Michael,Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Jan,What are you doing?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Michael,"Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Jan,Michael.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Michael,"No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby. But I just... just want to keep it within reason.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Jan,Michael.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Michael,They did this up in Albany...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Jan,You are not allowed in this session.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Michael,And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Jan,Now you're really not allowed in this session.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Michael,"Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Jan,I'm your boss.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Michael, Anybody want any coffee or...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,856,Jan,"We're fine, Michael. We just need you to leave, please.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,857,Michael,"Women in the workplace... yeah, translation ""I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls."" Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!",

2,15,Boys & Girls,858,Pam,Jan.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,858,Jan,"Yes, Pam?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,858,Pam,Michael's still at the door.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,858,Jan,Michael!,
2,15,Boys & Girls,859,Jan, So one obstacle is how assertiveness is perceived differently in men and women. Men who are assertive will be admired. They're called... anyone?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,860,Dwight,It's a terrible idea.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,860,Jim,What is?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,860,Dwight,Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,861,Michael,"Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this!",
2,15,Boys & Girls,862,Michael," Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,863,Michael,Let's just clap. Ready?  Yeah! Yeah!,
2,15,Boys & Girls,863,Dwight,Yeah!,
2,15,Boys & Girls,863,Michael,That's what I'm talking about!,
2,15,Boys & Girls,863,Jan,"I don't know what you're doing here, Michael,",
2,15,Boys & Girls,863,Michael,Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,863,Jan,... but it's very destructive.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,863,Michael,Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,863,Jan,"Can you please do this somewhere else, Michael?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,863,Michael,We have nowhere else Jan. This...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,863,Dwight,We could do it in the warehouse.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,863,Jan,"Dwight, excellent idea. Go to the warehouse.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,863,Michael,"OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,864,Michael,"Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,865,Dwight,Remember on Lost when they met the Others?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,866,Jan,"I'm so sorry about that... um... so where were we? Pam, are you okay taking notes then?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,866,Pam,Mmmhmm.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,866,Jan,Please? Thank you. very much.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,867,Michael,"So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,867,Darryl,My biggest fear is that someone will distract us from getting all the shipments out on time.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,867,Michael,"You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,867,Roy,Why?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,867,Michael,Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,867,Roy,I don't understand.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,867,Michael,Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,867,Kevin, I bet Roy heard about you liking Pam. I bet he'll try to beat you up.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,867,Jim,"Thanks for the head's up, Kev.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,867,Kevin,I've got your back if he does. But try to stay out of it.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,868,Michael," Uhhuhhuh. Just in case there's someone down here who shouldn't be. A little ""Good Will Hunting"" situation. All right. Troops. This is an important day. Big day. Now you may look around and see two groups here. White collar. Blue collar. But I don't see it that way. And you know why not? Because I am collar-blind.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,869,Jan,Why don't we go around the table and all say something that we know we're good at. I will start. I am good at public speaking.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,869,Meredith,Hi. I'm Meredith and I'm an alch... good at supplier relations.,

2,15,Boys & Girls,869,Angela, Really?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,869,Phyllis,I don't know. I thought that I wasn't going to be asked that...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,869,Jan,No. Okay. Stop. Go on...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,869,Angela,I've seen some of your spreadsheets.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,869,Phyllis,Really? I thought they were pretty...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,870,Pam,I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,871,Roy,"Jim... Halpert. Hey uh, I, uh, you know heard there's a rumor going around about you used to have a crush on Pam.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,871,Jim,"Oh, no, no. No.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,871,Roy,"No, it's cool, because I know you're a good guy. And I know that that crush ended a long time ago, so... you know. We're cool, right?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,871,Jim,Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,871,Roy,"You know, it's great with me cause that way, glad she has a friend at work she can get through the day with. She's not all bap bap bap bap when she gets home.",

2,15,Boys & Girls,871,Roy,"So, we're cool, right?",

2,15,Boys & Girls,871,Roy,Sweet.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,872,Darryl,"Hey, Mike, look. How bout we go upstairs, too. You know learn how the office works. We can all switch places today.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,872,Michael,"Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,872,Darryl,The experience...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,872,Michael,Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,873,Dwight,Okay. Let's go. Step up.,

2,15,Boys & Girls,875,Jan,Great! Uh-huh?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,875,Kelly,I want an SUV... with three rows of seats.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,876,Jan,"Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,877,Dwight,Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,877,Jim,Ponies.,

2,15,Boys & Girls,878,Michael,"Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,878,Darryl,Mike.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,878,Michael,Stand clear.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,878,Darryl,Mike. Get off of the lift. Please. Come on now.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,878,Michael,"I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,878,Darryl,"Look, would ya... look.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,878,Michael,"Oh, oh, oh! We'll get somebody to clean that up.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,878,Darryl,We're the ones that got to clean that up!,
2,15,Boys & Girls,878,Lonny,"Dammit, Michael!",
2,15,Boys & Girls,878,Michael,We ought to have this thing serviced.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,879,Michael,"So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,879,Madge,"Hey, do you want me to go?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,879,Michael,"No, why? Why would I... ? You could...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,879,Madge,I'll go.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,879,Michael,Stay or...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,880,Phyllis,...and a big walk-in closet.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,880,Meredith,"Oh, that's part of my dream too.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,880,Kelly,"Oh, me too.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,880,Jan,"Great, great. And Pam, what about you? What is your dream?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,880,Pam,"Well... I always dreamed of a house with a terrace upstairs. Plant flowers on it... stuff like that. Since I was a girl. Um... More seriously though, a husband that I love... Roy. And I love to draw. And I... I did a little in college and I'd still love to do something where I could work with art or graphic design in some way.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,880,Phyllis,She's real good.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,880,Pam,Thanks.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,880,Jan,You know the company is offering a design training program in New York.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,880,Pam,"Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,880,Jan,"Well, it's only on weekends and then a few weeks in New York, but I'm sure that I could ask Corporate to help you out.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,880,Pam,"Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,880,Jan,There are always a million reasons not to do something.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Michael,"Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Darryl,My priority is safety.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Michael,OK.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Darryl,"So it really bothers me when somebody comes in here speeding around on a lift, playing with it like a toy. It kind of gets under my skin.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Michael,"OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Darryl,Uh uh uh. Don't shush me.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Michael,I... That was just...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Darryl,That bothers me too.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Michael,I was breathing.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Roy,Pam shushes me. It drives me crazy.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Michael,"I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Lonny,"You know that's a good question, Hasselhoff. What bugs us?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,881,Michael,OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,882,Jan,All right. Let's talk about clothing.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,883,Phyllis,I'm excited about today.  I love girl talk.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,884,Jan,"Dress for the job you want, not the job you have. All right. You can use your clothing to send a message about your ambitions by wearing clothes that reflect what you aspire to be.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,885,Angela,"I'm not gaining anything from this seminar. I'm a professional woman. The head of accounting. I'm in the healthiest relationship of my life. I just think it's insulting that Jan thinks we need this. And, apparently, judging from her outfit, Jan aspires to be a whore.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Roy,"I hate it when girls insist on taking them out to new restaurants every weekend night and then they're like ""When are we going to go on a date-date?""",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Guy,I hate that too! ,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,I hate that too.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Kevin,That sucks so much.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Guy,It totally sucks.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Dwight,"Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like ""Gas ain't free!""",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Lonny,"Yeah, on our salaries, man, what do they expect? You know to take us out every weekend? You know what I mean? We're not millionaires.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Michael,I feel you.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,"No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Dwight,Not literally.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,"You say we're the same, but we get compensated very differently.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Michael,Yes.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,We work the same hours as you and you just said we work a lot harder,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Michael,"Ah, you do. So...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,But we get paid a lot less.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Dwight,Word.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Roy,Like next to no benefits.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Michael,I know. God! What is that?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Roy,Exactly.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Michael,"It blows. It blows, man. Gah...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,You know this would not happen if we had a union.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Roy,That's what I'm talking about.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Michael,"No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Roy,Absolutely.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,That's what we need.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Guy,You know you're right.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,"Man, see... That's what I've been sayin', man. We need to do this finally.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Michael,You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,"It's more than necessary, Mike. We need this. Roy? You still have that card from the Dockworker's Union?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Roy,In my truck.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Michael,Dockworker's?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,"Man, hook you up.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Guy,"Come on, man.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Michael,Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,"Union! Union, yeah.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Michael,The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,Are you with us Mike?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Michael,Yeah-es.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Darryl,Welcome to the warehouse.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,886,Group chant,"Michael, Michael, Michael, Mi...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,887,Jan,Another issue is inequality of pay between men and women. I'm sure that all of you have felt that before...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,887,Michael," This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,887,Jan,What? A union! What...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,887,Michael,Don't get hysterical.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,887,Jan,I'm not...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,888,Michael,Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Michael,Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Jan,"The cons are that everyone will lose their job. Michael. Everyone. Office, Warehouse. What do you think... the... pros... are... here?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Michael,Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Jan,"You got yourself into this Michael, so you get yourself out.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Michael,But we're bonding down there!,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Jan,That's too bad.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Michael,I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Jan,I don't want to...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Michael,Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Jan,Michael! Michael! Michael!,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Michael,We have a history...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Jan,Michael.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Michael,...between us.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Jan,Don't say another word.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Michael,I won't,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Jan,Get yourself down stairs.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,889,Michael,I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,890,Ryan,You know what... we could get this done a lot quicker if we formed a type of assembly line.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,890,Stanley,This here is a run-out-the-clock situation. Just like upstairs.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,891,Jan,"Sports metaphors are one of the ways women feel left out of the language of the office. Now, I know this might sound silly but a ... many women ask to go over it. So... Fumble means...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,891,Phyllis,Mistake.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,891,Meredith,Slip.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,891,Jan,"Right. Par for the course is a golf term. It means right on track. Below par means worse. Wait... that should mean better, that doesn't make sense.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,891,Kelly,What about second base? Like if Michael said that he got to second base with you? Does that mean you like closed a deal?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,891,Jan,Excuse me?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,891,Kelly,"I mean that's a baseball term, right?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,891,Jan,I don't know what Michael was talking about. I don't know.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Kelly, ...and you went to Chili's and he got to second base with you.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Jan," Kelly, I don't know what Michael's talking about.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Kelly, He told everybody so I just want to know is that a baseball term...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Pam,Hey.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Jim,Hey!,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Pam,How's it going down there?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Jim,"It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Pam,Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Jim,Did you really?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Pam,No. ,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Jim,Oh.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Pam,Almost.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Jim,Good.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Pam,"Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Jim,"Nice. Well, what's it all about?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Pam,Um...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Jim,I think you should do it. That's great!,
2,15,Boys & Girls,892,Pam,It's really cool.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,893,Michael,"Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,894,Angela,Are you married?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,894,Jan,I'm divorced.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,894,Phyllis,That must have been hard.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,894,Jan,It was. Yes.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,894,Kelly,You were probably feeling really depressed and sad and that's why you did that thing with Michael.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,894,Jan,I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your careers and less time on personal stuff.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,894,Phyllis,"Mmmm, I think we're all okay with the balance we've struck.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,894,Angela,"At least you don't have kids. You have no kids, right? Thank God.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,894,Jan,Okay. Let's take five. I think we can all use five.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,894,Kelly,How can someone so beautiful be so sad?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,895,Michael,Hi.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,895,Jan,Did you take care of the situation?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,895,Michael,"Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...",
2,15,Boys & Girls,895,Jan,Excuse me.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,895,Michael,I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some...,
2,15,Boys & Girls,895,Jan,"Excuse me. I've been told there's been some interest in forming a Union and that Michael supported it. Obviously he's not a friend of yours because he didn't tell you the facts. So let me. If there is even a whiff of unionizing in this branch, I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that . They unionized in Pittsfield and we all know what happened in Pittsfield. It will cost each of you a fortune in legal fees and union dues and that will be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs. So I would think long and hard before sacrificing your savings and your futures just to send a message. If you have any further questions you can direct them to... to Michael.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,896,Pam,Dreams are just that. They're dreams. They help get you through the day. Like the thing about the terrace. It's nice but... um... I don't know. It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,897,Jim,So you're not doing it.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,897,Pam,How did you know?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,897,Jim,Why not?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,897,Pam,Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,897,Jim,Come on.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,897,Pam,Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,897,Jim,Roy said that.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,897,Pam,What? You have something you want to say?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,897,Jim,"You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?",
2,15,Boys & Girls,897,Pam,"Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!",
2,15,Boys & Girls,897,Jim,You are?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,897,Pam,Yeah.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,898,Pam,"It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .",
2,15,Boys & Girls,899,Michael,I'm just going to put this over there.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,899,Darryl,This is not a good idea right here.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,899,Michael,You did uh... okay.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,900,Michael,Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza. Poor people love pizza. White people love pizza. Black people love pizza. Do black people like pizza?,
2,15,Boys & Girls,901,Michael,"Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,901,All the Men,Generalized mumbling agreement. Yeah.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,901,Michael,"Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.",
2,15,Boys & Girls,902,Michael,Thank you to our hosts.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,902,Darryl,Hey Michael. This ain't over.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,903,Michael,Ahhh! Excellent.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,904,Michael,Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.,
2,15,Boys & Girls,905,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,906,Pam,"I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...",
2,16,Valentine's Day,907,Pam, Phyllis.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,907,Delivery man,Would you sign here? ,
2,16,Valentine's Day,908,Pam,"Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,909,Meredith,"""Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.""",
2,16,Valentine's Day,909,Phyllis,Isn't he sweet?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,909,Meredith,Yeah. Wow.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,910,Michael,"Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today.  Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,910,Dwight,And you want me to come with you.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,910,Michael,Nope. The opposite of that.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,910,Dwight,I will stay here and run things on this end.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,910,Michael,"Ok, good.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,910,Dwight,Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,910,Michael,"I probably will, why do you ask?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,910,Dwight,"Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...",
2,16,Valentine's Day,910,Michael,Yeah.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,910,Dwight,Screwed.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,911,Michael,"This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,912,Michael,"Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,912,Pam,That's OK.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,912,Michael,Alright.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,912,Oscar,"The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,912,Michael,"Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!",
2,16,Valentine's Day,913,Michael,"Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,914,Jim,"So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,915,Dwight,What's this? What is this?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,915,Dwight,"Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,915,Jim,It was there when I sat down.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,915,Dwight, Happy Valentine's Day.  It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes!  Ahh!,
2,16,Valentine's Day,916,Michael,"The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. ",
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Jim,Hey Kelly. What's up?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Kelly,"Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Jim,"OH, that's great. I'm really happy for ",
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Kelly,"And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like ""Ryan, what's taking you so long?"" And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Jim,Wow.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Kelly,"So I said, ""Ryan, what took you so long?"" And I just said that to him, can you believe that?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Jim,Wow.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Kelly,"Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Jim,"No, don't be.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Kelly,"Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Jim,I bet.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Kelly,"So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,917,Jim,Alright. ,
2,16,Valentine's Day,918,Ryan, I hooked up with her on February 13th.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,919,Michael,"Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat.  We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,920,Kevin,Woah. ,
2,16,Valentine's Day,920,Pam,Guess what?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,920,Phyllis,"Really, Oh, they're from Bob again.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,920,Pam,That's great. ,
2,16,Valentine's Day,921,Michael,"Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to  Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,922,Michael,"This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey . That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi?  OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were , OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey.  Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,923,Dwight,"Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,923,Angela,"Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,923,Dwight,Oh I did. I did.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,923,Angela,I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,923,Dwight,"Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,923,Angela,"Really? Well, I hope I do.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,924,Michael,"I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids.  OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back, should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,925,Jim," Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.",

2,16,Valentine's Day,929,Pam,You need to get something for your girlfriend.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,929,Dwight," Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...",
2,16,Valentine's Day,929,Pam,Tightly wound?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,929,Dwight,(smirking) Exactly.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,929,Pam,"Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,929,Dwight,"You mean, like a ham?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,929,Pam,"No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,929,Dwight,"Ok, I get it.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,929,Pam,That you remember her.,

2,16,Valentine's Day,930,Craig,"Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said ""You gotta fire four people,"" and I was just like, ""What?"" Ya know?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,930,Josh,Did you?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,930,Craig,"No, I just ignored her. She's the worse.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,930,Josh,She is our boss.,

2,16,Valentine's Day,930,Michael,"Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.",

2,16,Valentine's Day,930,Josh,You hooked up with Jan?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,930,Michael,"You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,",

2,16,Valentine's Day,932,Jan,Fine Michael. Thank you.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,932,David,OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...,
2,16,Valentine's Day,933,Jan,"Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,934,Josh,"So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,934,David,Thanks very much.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,934,Josh,Thank you.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,934,David,"OK, Michael.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,934,Michael,"What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. ",
2,16,Valentine's Day,934,Michael," Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special.  This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,935,Michael,"Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,936,Michael," And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants. Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. ",
2,16,Valentine's Day,936,Michael,Questions?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,937,David,"Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,937,Michael,"Yes, thank you.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,937,David,"But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,937,Michael,"Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... ",
2,16,Valentine's Day,938,Delivery man, Can you sign?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,938,Pam,Yeah.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,938,Pam, Oscar.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,938,Angela,Nothing for me?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,938,Pam, Join the club.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,938,Kevin,Whose it from? ,
2,16,Valentine's Day,938,Oscar,My mom. ,
2,16,Valentine's Day,939,Kelly,"It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,939,Jim,"You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,939,Kelly,"Yeah, it would be so great if he was.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,939,Jim,"Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,939,Kelly,"Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? ",
2,16,Valentine's Day,940,Dan,"And that about does it, thank you.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,940,Jan,"OK.  Craig,",
2,16,Valentine's Day,940,Craig,Yeah. Here's the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on... like report or whatnot.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,940,Jan,"Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,940,Craig,"I was under the impression this was, more of like... a meet and greet type deal.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,940,David,"So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,940,Craig,"That is correct, yes.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,940,Jan,"Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,940,Craig,"Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,940,Jan,"Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,940,Craig,"Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too. ",
2,16,Valentine's Day,941,Michael,"Oh, ok. Alright.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,941,Jan,"NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,941,Michael,No you're not.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,941,Jan,"Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just  can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,941,Michael,"Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...",
2,16,Valentine's Day,941,Jan,"Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,941,Michael,Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,941,Jan,"Surely, you cannot be serious?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,941,Michael,I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,942,Dwight,"Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,943,Roy,Hey babe.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,943,Pam,Hey.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,943,Roy,You almost ready to go?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,943,Pam,"I guess, yeah.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,943,Roy,What's wrong?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,943,Pam,"Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,943,Roy,"What, you're mad at me?",
2,16,Valentine's Day,943,Roy,"Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best s*x of you life.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,944,David,You understand this is a very serious situation.,
2,16,Valentine's Day,944,Michael,"No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. ",
2,16,Valentine's Day,944,David,You made a joke?,
2,16,Valentine's Day,944,Michael,"I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. ",
2,16,Valentine's Day,944,David,Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...,
2,16,Valentine's Day,944,Michael,"I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,944,Jan,"Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it.",
2,16,Valentine's Day,944,David,Good. ,
2,16,Valentine's Day,945,Pam,Heading out?,

2,17,Dwight's Speech,948,Michael,Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,948,Dwight,They are either going to say yes... or no.,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,948,Michael,Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,948,Dwight,Think it through.,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,948,Michael,Have to think it through. Because if they say no...,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,948,Jim,Can we not?,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,948,Michael,"No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long.  Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh!  Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.",
2,17,Dwight's Speech,948,Jim,Still want that.,

2,17,Dwight's Speech,949,Jim,Cugino's pizza.,

2,17,Dwight's Speech,952,Pam,I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.,

2,17,Dwight's Speech,953,Dwight,Ha! I don't get it.,

2,17,Dwight's Speech,954,Michael,"Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.",

2,17,Dwight's Speech,966,Pam,You mean Toastmasters?,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,966,Michael,"Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.",

2,17,Dwight's Speech,966,Kevin,You should go to Hedonism.,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,966,Jim,What is that?,

2,17,Dwight's Speech,971,Dwight,Yes. I am.,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,971,Jim,"The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.",
2,17,Dwight's Speech,971,Dwight,Which is?,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,971,Jim,You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.,

2,17,Dwight's Speech,979,Michael,"Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?",
2,17,Dwight's Speech,980,Kevin,I always set it at 69. ,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,981,Pam,Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,981,Kelly,"But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding. I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?",

2,17,Dwight's Speech,981,Ryan,I know what I said.,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,982,Michael,"I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot.  Michael Winslow, anyone?",
2,17,Dwight's Speech,983,Michael,"Car starting.  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.",
2,17,Dwight's Speech,983,Michael,Good luck. That is a tough crowd.,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,983,Dwight," Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day.  how long we have been striving for greatness?  Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle . A never-ending fight.

2,17,Dwight's Speech,985,Ryan,"Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.",
2,17,Dwight's Speech,986,Dwight,No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. ,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,986,Dwight,"Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...",

2,17,Dwight's Speech,987,Jim,Alright.,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,988,Dwight,"Ok, thanks.  There you are. What happened?",
2,17,Dwight's Speech,988,Michael,I got thirsty. How'd it go?,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,988,Dwight,It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.,

2,17,Dwight's Speech,988,Dwight,Con artist.,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,988,Michael,She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?,
2,17,Dwight's Speech,989,Michael,"Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?",

2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1014,Michael,"Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1014,Sasha,What's a Nazi?,
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1014,Michael,What's a Nazi?,

2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1014,Michael,"Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1014,Dwight,I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.,
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1014,Michael, Why don't you just leave? Okay?,

2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1016,Angela,"You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities .",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Michael,"This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these?  You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Melissa,So... you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.,
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Michael,"No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Abby,That's not fair. ,
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Michael,"Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Jake,You're just a middleman.,
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Michael,I'm not just a middle... man...,
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Melissa,"Wait, why doesn't the saw mill just sell paper directly to people?",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Michael,"You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Dwight,We have better service than they do!,
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Michael,"...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Creed,That is correct.,
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Michael,Say hi to the kids.,
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1017,Creed,Hi kids.,

2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1018,Michael,I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.,
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1018,Abby,That doesn't sound like a show.,
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1018,Melissa,What?!,
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1018,Michael,"It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this.  Ryan, can you come here a second?  I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement.

2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1019,Michael," Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1020,Michael,"I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1021,Michael,"I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1021,Miss Trudy," ...Bundle, are you ready to come on in?  Let's have some fun!",
2,18,Take Your Daughter to Work Day,1021,Michael,"That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...",

2,19,Michael's Birthday,1042,Oscar,It's going to be okay.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1042,Angela,"You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1043,Delivery Woman,"Hi, delivery for Michael Scott.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1043,Michael,"Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great!  Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink!  Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?",

2,19,Michael's Birthday,1043,Delivery Woman,Oh. Thanks.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1044,Michael,"When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1045,Michael, Stop it. Stop! What is that?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1045,Dwight,"It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1045,Michael,"Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1045,Dwight,I probably care more than she does.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1045,Michael,You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this .,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1046,Pam,When does he hear?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1046,Jim,Sometime today.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1046,Pam,Ohh... poor Kevin.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1047,Pam,"If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Dwight,"Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents. Unfortunately, this item is on  back... order...  Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here! Come here!",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Michael,What?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Dwight,"Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Michael," Ohhh, God.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Dwight,There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Michael,"Ohhh, no.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Dwight,So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!,

2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Dwight,Creed! Come on. Stanley!,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Pam,...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Jim,"Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Dwight,"On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Michael,Okay.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1048,Dwight,"Happy birth moment, Michael.",

2,19,Michael's Birthday,1049,Dwight,"F. Alright, what's the damage?",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1049,Delivery Boy,"Uh, thirty-nine sixty.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1049,Dwight, Thirty nine... sixty.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1050,Dwight,"Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1051,Dwight,Here they come.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1051,Michael,Get in here... everybody.,

2,19,Michael's Birthday,1051,Michael,Yes.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1051,Angela,Bologna? I don't eat bologna.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1051,Michael,"Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1051,Angela,No.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1051,Michael,"Just the bread, it's fresh baked.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1051,Angela,No.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1051,Michael,Mm-kay. Get whatever you want.  And choke on it.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1052,Jim,"So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1052,Pam,Sixty-nine cup of noodles.,

2,19,Michael's Birthday,1053,Dwight,What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1053,Angela,Yes...  but don't expect any cookie.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1053,Dwight, But what if i'm hungry?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1054,Jim, ...What?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1054,Pam,You use fabric softener?,

2,19,Michael's Birthday,1055,Michael,Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... ,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1055,Dwight,Yaoo yay! ,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1055,Michael,... I asked for trick candles.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1055,Dwight,Pam was supposed to get 'em.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1055,Michael,"Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again.  Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1055,Angela,No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1055,Michael,"... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us .",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1056,Pam, We should probably head back.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1056,Jim,Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1056,Pam,You dare me? How old are you?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1056,Jim,Just... quit stalling.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1056,Pam," Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1056,Jim,Such a dork.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1056,Pam," Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1056,Store Employee,Ma'am? Please don't touch that. That is not a toy.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1056,Pam,Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1056,Jim,How old are you?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1056,Pam,I hate you.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1057,Toby," Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1057,Michael,There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1057,Kevin,Still scary.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1057,Michael,"Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1057,Kevin,Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1057,Michael,And laughter... also.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1057,Toby,I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1057,Michael,Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1057,Toby,I work here.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1057,Michael," Nyeh, I work here.  Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1057,Kevin,"If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1057,Michael,"Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1058,Dwight,"Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1058,Jim,"Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1058,Dwight,"Please, don't.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1058,Jim,You... owe me.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1058,Michael,"Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1058,Stanley,Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1058,Michael,How dare you sir. You are gross.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1059,Michael, That should not be there.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1059,Dwight,I'll get someone to take it down.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1059,Michael,"No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1060,Kelly,Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1060,Ryan,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1061,Jim,Think you can let go?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1061,Pam,No. ,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1061,Jim,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. ,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1061,Dwight,YEAH!,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1061,Pam,Who is that?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1061,Jim,Is that Michael?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1062,Michael,"Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1063,Pam,I got it.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1063,Michael,"Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1063,Jim,...It's something to think about.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Kevin,"I can't relax about it, you know?",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Michael,Kevin. You heard anything yet?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Kevin,"No, not yet.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Michael,Okay. Well. Live strong.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Kevin,"Okay, Michael.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Michael,Alright.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Carol,Michael?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Michael,"Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Carol,"Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Michael,"Oh, these... all your kids?",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Carol,No just the front two.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Michael,"Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Carol,Sure.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1064,Michael,Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1065,Michael,Push. Good! That's great. You got it.  Excuse me.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1065,Kevin,"Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks.  It was negative.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1065,Michael,"Oh... God...  God!  We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here .",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1066,Michael,"Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1067,Kevin,"This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1067,Michael,"Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!",
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1067,Dwight,Turn it around. Turn it around.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1067,Michael,Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1067,Dwight,Number one!!,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1067,Michael,Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1067,Pam,Michael?,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1067,Michael,Yeah.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1067,Pam,This is from all of us.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1067,Michael,Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.,
2,19,Michael's Birthday,1068,Pam,Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1069,Dwight,"Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out.  Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1070,Jim,"You look cute today, Dwight.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1070,Dwight,"Thanks, girl.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1071,Dwight,"Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1071,Kevin, Hey...,
2,20,Drug Testing,1072,Dwight,"I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1073,Jim, I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1073,Pam," Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um,  that's supposed to be Phyllis. I can't do it as good as he can.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1074,Kelly,"And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said ""Is it okay if I sip it?"" and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1074,Dwight,"Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour. Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is is on the line! Now I'm going to ask you again. What time did you go home last night?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1074,Kelly,Six.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Dwight,I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Ryan,I go to a lot of parties.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Dwight,"Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me you keys.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Ryan,I am not giving you my keys.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Dwight,Don't make me do this the hard way.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Ryan,What's the hard way?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Dwight,"I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Ryan,"Yeah, let's do it that way.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Michael,"Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Dwight,I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Jim,Whoa. You are a volunteer.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Dwight,I volunteered for this job.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Jim,And that's not the same.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Dwight,It is my duty...,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Jim, Volunteer duty.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Dwight,...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Michael, Narc!,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Dwight,If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Michael,I wasn't attempting to compliment you.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Dwight,"Well, you have...",
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Michael,"Uuf, well...",
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Dwight,...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Michael, Okay...,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Dwight,...and I am very proud of being a narc.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Michael,"Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God!  Dude, where's my office?  I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!",
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Jim,"Well, your office is behind you.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1075,Michael,Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1076,Ryan,I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1077,Dwight,Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1078,Dwight,Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1078,Oscar,"No, I have not.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1078,Dwight,Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1078,Oscar,What are you implying?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1078,Dwight,Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1078,Oscar,Okay. I'm done with this.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1078,Dwight,He sure left in a hurry.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1079,Dwight,I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1080,Dwight,Do you know what this is? ,
2,20,Drug Testing,1080,Phyllis,"Yes, it's marijuana.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1080,Dwight,How do you know that?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1080,Phyllis,It's labeled.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1080,Dwight, Dammit.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1081,Creed,That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1081,Dwight,"No, it's marijuana.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1082,Jim,I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1082,Dwight,"That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1082,Jim,"Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1082,Dwight,I would remember.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1082,Jim,"Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1082,Dwight,That's not how it works.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1082,Jim,Now how do you know how it works?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1082,Dwight,"Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1082,Jim,No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Oscar,"So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Jim,"Oh, um... Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me? ",
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Stanley,Is that supposed to be me?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Jim,"Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Stanley,I do not think that is funny.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Pam,He does everyone in the office.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Stanley,Hmmmpt.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Pam/Jim, I do not think that is funny.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Pam,Jinx! Buy me a coke.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Jim,Oh...,
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Pam,"No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke. Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid. ",
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Pam,Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Jim, C'mon!,
2,20,Drug Testing,1083,Pam,"Sorry, that's not my problem.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1084,Dwight,"I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1084,Angela,I understand.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1084,Dwight,Where were you yesterday after work?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1085,Michael,Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling? Ratting somebody out. Narc! Narc! Kevin?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1085,Kevin,"That is so good, Michael",
2,20,Drug Testing,1085,Michael,"Remember the narc bit?  Uh-oh, who's in trouble?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1086,Dwight,Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1086,Michael,Waa... what? What are you talking about?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1086,Dwight,Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1086,Oscar,"Is that true, Toby?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1086,Toby,"Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1087,Michael,"Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1088,Michael,"Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1088,Dwight,No you can't do that.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1088,Michael,"I can do that, it is my office.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1088,Michael,Hmmm. Ha.  Alright. Great.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1089,Dwight,"Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1089,Kevin,I'm not taking Rogaine.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1089,Dwight,"Angela, what about you?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1089,Angela,I don't take any prescription drugs.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1089,Dwight,Good.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1090,Kelly,"So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress!  One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything.  I mean not everything, Jim.  I promise, I'm not that kind of...",
2,20,Drug Testing,1090,Pam,"Hey guys, what's going on?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1090,Kelly,We're having the best conversation. ,
2,20,Drug Testing,1090,Pam,"Oh, okay. Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room.  But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. ",
2,20,Drug Testing,1090,Kelly,"So, I was looking so hot...",
2,20,Drug Testing,1091,Michael,It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1091,Phyllis,We don't feel that way.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1091,Angela,"No, not at all.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1091,Oscar,You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1091,Michael,"No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, ""Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.""",
2,20,Drug Testing,1091,Dwight,"Thank you, Michael.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1092,Michael,"I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Michael,"Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot. I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Stanley,Where did you get these facts?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Michael,"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Stanley,They are not.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Michael,Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Stanley,"No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week. For the antioxidants.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Michael,"Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Toby,"Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Michael,Yes it is.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Toby,"No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Michael,"Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down?  In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Toby,You can't do that.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Michael,"I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Toby,That's not random.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Michael,"Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Pam,I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Michael,Really? ,
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Pam,"Uh, hmmm.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1093,Michael,"Jim it's okay. You can t...  This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you.  It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you.  Oh, he's doing it, okay.  It's okay.  Oh. Okay, are you sure?  That looked like it was going to be good. Alright.  Okay, well.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1094,Pam,Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1095,Michael,"The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1095,Dwight,"No, you will be tested.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1095,Michael,"Yes, I will not be.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1095,Dwight,You will be. That is the law according to the rules.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1095,Michael,"Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1096,Dwight,"Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1096,Linda,We test a lot of urine.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1096,Dwight,Mine was green.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1096,Linda,"Oh, right. How are you?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1096,Dwight,I'm all better.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Michael,So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Dwight,What kind of filing?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Michael,Just forget it. Just the urine.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Dwight,That goes directly to the tester.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Michael,Just. I need your urine.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Dwight,Like in a cup?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Michael,"Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Dwight,For what purpose?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Michael,It's none of your business.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Dwight,Then I refuse.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Michael,"Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Dwight,Are you serious?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Michael,I need clean urine for the lady.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Dwight,But that's illegal.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Michael,"Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes",
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Dwight,Not my urine.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Michael,A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Dwight,Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1097,Michael,"No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1098,Angela,Do you want to give Michael your urine?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1098,Dwight,I want him to have all the urine he needs.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1098,Angela,You're not going to get my permission on this.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1098,Dwight,I know that. Don't you think I know that?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1099,Linda,"Yeah, we do testing all over the country.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1099,Ryan,"Cool. Hey, are you guys hiring?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1099,Linda,You want to work at the urinalysis lab?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1099,Ryan,Yeah. Maybe.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1100,Dwight,"My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1101,Pam,"What?  Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something.  You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason.  Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. ",
2,20,Drug Testing,1102,Kevin,I'd like a magazine.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1102,Linda,"We just need urine, sir.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1102,Kevin,I'd still like one.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1103,Michael,"Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1103,Dwight,That's great.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1103,Michael,What's wrong? Where's your costume?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1103,Dwight,It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1103,Michael,Why? Wha...,
2,20,Drug Testing,1103,Dwight,I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1104,Pam, Here.  Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. ,
2,20,Drug Testing,1104,Jim,Hi.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1104,Pam,Hey.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1104,Jim,How much time do you have left on your break?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1104,Pam,Ten minutes.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Michael,"Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Dwight,Really?,
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Michael,"Yes, sir.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Dwight,That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .,
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Michael,So you wanna? Thanks.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Hank,"Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Michael,Okay.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Hank,Here's your badge.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Dwight,"Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great.  Can I have a gun?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Hank,"No, I don't have a gun.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Dwight,"Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Hank,I don't think so.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Michael,Good.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Dwight," Thank you, Michael.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Michael,No. Oh. Uh...,
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Dwight,I need to go over some details with you.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Michael,"Alright.  Well, Thank you.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Dwight,"First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?",
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Hank,Two.,
2,20,Drug Testing,1105,Dwight,"Oh, God.",
2,20,Drug Testing,1106,Jim,Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk. Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael? I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1107,Kevin,"So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1107,Pam,No.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1107,Kevin,'Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1108,Jim,"Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1109,Phyllis,Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1109,Pam,Yeah?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1109,Phyllis,"Yeah, pretty stationery.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1109,Pam,"Oh, thanks!",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1109,Angela,I didn't get mine yet.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1109,Pam,Uh...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1110,Pam,"There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ... it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1111,Michael,"Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1112,Phyllis,"Uh, on or off?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1112,I.D. Photographer,Off.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1112,Phyllis,Okay... ,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1112,Dwight,Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1112,Phyllis, Excuse me.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1112,Dwight,Clown paint.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1113,Dwight,"I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1114,Michael,That's a nice tie.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1114,Ryan,Thank you.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1114,Michael,That is... who makes that?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1114,Ryan,"Um, I don't...",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1114,Michael,Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1114,Ryan,"Um... let's um, let's keep our clothes.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1115,Oscar,"It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1115,Michael, What's the dealio?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1115,Toby,"Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1115,Michael,What's the problem?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1115,Oscar,Angela!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1115,Toby,It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1115,Oscar,Since Christmas.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1115,Michael,"So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1115,Oscar,No.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1115,Toby,"Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1115,Michael,Yes.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1116,Toby,Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1116,Michael,Yeah?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1116,Toby,These things just have a way of working themselves out.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1116,Michael,Okay.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1116,Toby,"It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1116,Michael,What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1116,Toby,Okay.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1116,Michael,Okay... what?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1116,Toby,That was the right decision for me and my marriage.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1116,Michael,"Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized.  Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1117,Michael," A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict. My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1117,Angela,Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1117,Michael,"No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1117,Oscar,What's the next one?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1117,Michael,"Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1117,Angela,Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1117,Michael,"Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Michael," Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using ""I"" emotion language and no judging or ""you"" statements.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Angela,"I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Michael,"Come on, seriously, that?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Oscar,"I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Michael,"Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Pam,Win!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Michael,"Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Oscar,No.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Angela,That's... no...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Michael,"Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Angela,"How about, I leave it up?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Oscar,"How 'bout, she takes it down?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Pam,"How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Michael,"Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Pam,Win.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Oscar,Fine.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Angela,"But, it...",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Michael, It is done!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1118,Pam,Win,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1119,Photographer," No, you're all good.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1119,Creed,Great. ,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1120,Pam,"Hey, Angela. I didn't have your zip code.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1120,Angela,Oh. Thanks.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1121,Angela,"It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1122,Toby,You solved it?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1122,Michael,Yes.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1122,Toby,"Well, good. We can, uh, throw that one out. ",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1122,Michael,Are those all the other complains?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1122,Toby,Mmm-Hm.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1122,Michael,I would like to see those please.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1122,Toby,I... I can't do that.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1122,Michael,"You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1122,Toby,That... ,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1122,Michael,Okay.  There! No more conflict.  I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty.  All right... is that it?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1122,Toby, It's all Dwight's.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1123,Toby,"Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1124,Michael,Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1125,Photographer,Are you sure? ,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1125,Dwight,"Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1126,Michael," This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1126,Pam,Nice.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1126,Michael,You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1127,Toby,"Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This is January through March of this year. ",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1128,Michael,"How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee?  And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on?  That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering...  Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1128,Angela,You already did me.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1128,Michael,"That's what she said.  The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does ""redacted"" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked ""redacted""... ?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1128,Toby,"Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1128,Michael,"Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1128,Dwight,"Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1128,Pam, Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1128,Michael,"All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And ... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1128,Pam,"Wait, what did it say?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1128,Michael,"Uh... ""Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?""  Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1129,Pam,I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Michael,"Here is a Kelly complaint: ""Ryan never returns my calls."" Ugh, join the club.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Ryan,My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Kelly,I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Toby,To your HR representative.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Kelly,"To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Toby,"Fine, I'll take your name off.  So no one will know.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Michael, Makin' progress.  Yes?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Jim,Dwight tried to kiss me.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Michael,What?!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Jim,And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Dwight,That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Jim,"Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Dwight,"Okay, question.  When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1130,Toby,Sure.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1131,Michael,Stanley. ,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1131,Pam, Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1131,Michael, You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1131,Anglea,I didn't do it! ,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1131,Pam,I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1132,Michael,"Someone complained that the men's room is ""whites only"". Stanley, you know that's not true.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1132,Stanley,I didn't say that.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1132,Creed,Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? ,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1132,Michael,"Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1132,Phyllis,"No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1132,Michael,"And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1132,Phyllis,"Stanley and I are close, too.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1132,Stanley,We sit close.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1132,Michael,Oh... ok.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1133,Toby, Just take it. ,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1134,Pam,"I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1134,Jim,"Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1134,Pam,Don't take her side.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1134,Jim," Well, what does Roy think about everything?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1134,Pam,I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1134,Jim,You mean your thoughts and feelings?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1134,Pam,Yeah.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1134,Jim,Yeah...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1135,Phyllis,"I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1135,Angela,"Yes, that's the problem.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1135,Phyllis,I guess so...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1135,Michael,"Okay, well... all settled, then.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1135,Phyllis, I don't like you.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1136,Michael,"OK, Ryan. You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1137,Creed,I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1138,Michael,"All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution: Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1138,Kevin,I accept your decision!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1139,Jim,"Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1139,Dwight,That doesn't make any sense.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1139,Jim,"Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1139,Photographer, Smile.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1139,Dwight,No.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1140,Dwight,"I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1141,Jim,This came out really well.  There you go.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1141,Dwight,This is humongous. I am not a security threat...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1141,Jim,Oh.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1141,Dwight,"And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1141,Jim,What did I write?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1142,Dwight,I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1142,Toby,Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1142,Dwight,What box?!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Phyllis,But I didn't report your snoring-,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Stanley,"Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... ",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Michael,Uh. Dwight.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Dwight,"Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Michael,Okay! Calm down.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Dwight,No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Michael,"Hey, hey!",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Dwight,Him or me?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Michael,Stop.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Dwight,Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Michael,Okay...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Dwight,"Either he goes, or I go.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Michael,Dwight...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Dwight,You choose!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Michael,Stop...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Dwight,One of us is out of here by the end of today! ,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1143,Michael,Oh... kay...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1144,Dwight,I am not bluffing!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1144,Michael,Okay.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1144,Dwight,Okay?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1144,Michael,Yes.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1144,Dwight,"Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1144,Michael,Mm-hmm.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1144,Dwight,I deserve this. You know I do!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1144,Michael, You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1144,Dwight,You have till five.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1145,Dwight,"Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1145,Michael,"Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1146,Michael,"Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1147,Michael,"Okay, so Dwight, in your own words -  ""Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.""  ""Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.""",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1148,Jim, Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1149,Michael," ""This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.""  ""Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can."" Gah. ""This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.""",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1150,Jim,"That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1151,Michael," ""Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.""",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1152,Jim,"Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1153,Michael,"""By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.""",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1154,Jim,"Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1155,Michael,"The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1156,Jim,Maybe Stanford would be cool.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1156,Dwight,It's a good market. Higher volume.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1156,Jim,Yeah. Maybe we should both go.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1156,Dwight,I have a girlfriend...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1156,Jim,"Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1157,Michael,"Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1157,Dwight,"So, you going to transfer Jim or not?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1157,Michael,"Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1157,Dwight,I want an answer by tomorrow.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1158,Michael,"Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1158,Dwight,Fine.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1158,Michael,Good. Okay.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1159,Michael,Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1159,Photographer,I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1159,Michael,"Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1159,Photographer,You mean digital?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1159,Michael,It'll take like two seconds.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1159,Photographer,20 bucks.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1159,Michael,"Ugh... All right. Everybody,  come on. Group photo for the newsletter.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1159,Stanley,You gotta be kiddin' me.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1159,Michael,"Come on, everybody.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1159,Dwight,"Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Photographer,"One, two, three... smile.  Try to smile.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Michael,"We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Photographer,"Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three... whether you smile or not. One, two, three. ",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Michael,"Good, let's check that out.  Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Photographer,That'll be another 20.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Michael,What?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Pam,"Angela, I want to talk to you about something.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Michael, You just press the button.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Angela,What?,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Jim,"No, Pam.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Pam, I am.  It's about the Save The Date.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Jim,"Pam, it wasn't her.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Pam,What?!,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Jim,I'm the one who complained about you.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Jim,I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down.  I was just venting.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Michael," Okay, good. Check that out.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Jim,"You know, it was one day.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Michael, That's terrible.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Jim,And I took it right back. It was like...,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Pam,Okay.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Phyllis,"Oh, dear.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1160,Michael," Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger.  Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. ",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1161,Michael,It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.,
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1162,Michael," One, two.. Didn't say three, did I?",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1163,Michael,"But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1164,Jim," Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. ",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1164,Female worker,"Okay, Jan will see you now.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1164,Jim,"Oh, thanks.",
2,21,Conflict Resolution,1165,Michael,And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.,
2,22,Casino Night,1166,Michael,"Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, ""Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening."" Makes you feel good.",
2,22,Casino Night,1167,Jim,Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?,
2,22,Casino Night,1167,Dwight,"I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.",
2,22,Casino Night,1167,Pam,It's a nice tux.,
2,22,Casino Night,1167,Dwight,"I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.",
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Roy,"So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.",
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Pam,"Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.",
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Dwight,"Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.",
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Jim,I can always kind of win at roulette.,
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Dwight,"Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.",
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Jim,Yeah.,
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Dwight,How would you do that?,
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Jim,Mind control.,
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Dwight, You can't be serious. Are you serious?,
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Jim,"Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.",
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Dwight,I don't believe you. Continue.,
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Jim,"It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.",
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Dwight," That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.",
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Jim,"Okay, I'll try.  ",
2,22,Casino Night,1168,Dwight,"Oh, my God.",
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Michael,I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.,
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Jan," Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.",
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Michael,Top 80 percent!,
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Jan,Michael?,
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Michael,Yeah?,
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Jan,You know that I'm very serious here.,
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Michael,"Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!",
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Jan,What?,
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Michael,"Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.",
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Jan,I thought that you were their fearless leader.,
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Michael,"I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.",
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Jan, I think you can handle it.,
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Michael,"Oh, come on. Come on.",
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Jan,"I think so, Michael...",
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Michael,"You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.",
2,22,Casino Night,1169,Jan,"Goodbye, Michael.",
2,22,Casino Night,1170,Michael,"Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.",
2,22,Casino Night,1171,Michael,"Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.",
2,22,Casino Night,1171,Oscar,Again? We do that every year.,
2,22,Casino Night,1171,Michael,"Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.",
2,22,Casino Night,1171,Oscar,It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.,
2,22,Casino Night,1171,Michael,"Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.",
2,22,Casino Night,1171,Dwight,Yes!,
2,22,Casino Night,1171,Michael,"So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.",
2,22,Casino Night,1171,Jim,That doesn't exist anymore.,
2,22,Casino Night,1171,Michael,"Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.",
2,22,Casino Night,1171,Pam,"No, they stopped making that show.",
2,22,Casino Night,1171,Michael,"Well, then, they need our money more than ever.",
2,22,Casino Night,1171,Angela,"You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.",
2,22,Casino Night,1172,Creed,There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.,
2,22,Casino Night,1173,Kevin,Something with animals. Or people.,
2,22,Casino Night,1174,Angela,"We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves, and donate that money to charity?",
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Michael,"Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...",
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Toby,"Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?",
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Michael,"Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.",
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Jim,I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.,
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Michael,"No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.",
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Phyllis,Afghani.,
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Michael,What?,
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Phyllis,Afghani.,
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Michael,That's a dog.,
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Pam,"No, that's Afghan.",
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Michael,That's a shawl.,
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Dwight,"Wait, canine AIDS?",
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Michael,No. Humans with AIDS.,
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Creed,Who has AIDS?,
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Jim,"Guys, the Afghanistananies.",
2,22,Casino Night,1175,Michael,"Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.",
2,22,Casino Night,1176,Michael,"There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. ""I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.""  And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.",
2,22,Casino Night,1177,Jim,What are you doing?,
2,22,Casino Night,1177,Pam,"Oh, nothing.",
2,22,Casino Night,1177,Jim,"""Till Death Do Us Rock.""",
2,22,Casino Night,1177,Pam,They're wedding bands.,
2,22,Casino Night,1177,Jim,Oh.,
2,22,Casino Night,1177,Pam,"Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.",
2,22,Casino Night,1177,Jim,"Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.",
2,22,Casino Night,1177,Pam,There's a KISS cover band in here.,
2,22,Casino Night,1177,Jim,Let's do it.,
2,22,Casino Night,1178,Pam,I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.,
2,22,Casino Night,1179,Jim,"Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.",
2,22,Casino Night,1180,Michael,I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?,

2,22,Casino Night,1180,Darryl, Dinkin' flicka.,
2,22,Casino Night,1181,Darryl,"I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, ""Fleece it out."" ""Going mach five."" ""Dinkin' flicka."" You know, things us Negroes say.",

2,22,Casino Night,1184,Jim,"Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh, my God, he's the drummer and the singer.",
2,22,Casino Night,1185,Kevin,We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.,
2,22,Casino Night,1186,Jim,Wow. Oh!,
2,22,Casino Night,1186,Pam,"Oh, my...",
2,22,Casino Night,1186,Jim,"Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...",

2,22,Casino Night,1188,Pam,It's still me.,
2,22,Casino Night,1189,Pam,Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.,
2,22,Casino Night,1190,Pam,"Carol, you're on with Michael.",
2,22,Casino Night,1190,Carol," Hello, Michael?",
2,22,Casino Night,1190,Michael,"Hi, Carol. How you doing?",

2,22,Casino Night,1216,Carol,She seems really nice.,
2,22,Casino Night,1216,Michael,"Oh, she's great.",
2,22,Casino Night,1217,Michael,"Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.",
2,22,Casino Night,1218,Pam," About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say. Yes, I know. Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend. Yeah, he's great. Yeah, I think I am.  I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... ",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1219,Jim, You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1219,Pam,Me too. ...I think we're just drunk.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1219,Jim,No I'm not drunk. Are you drunk?,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1219,Pam,No...  Jim---,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1219,Jim,Are you really gonna marry him?  ...Ok.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1220,Michael,"No! That is the fun of this place. I call everybody ""faggie"". Why would anybody find that offensive?",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1220,Toby,"OK I think Oscar would just like if you used ""lame"" or something like that.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1220,Michael,That's what faggie means!,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1220,Toby,No not really...,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1221,Toby,"Apparently you called Oscar ""faggie"" for liking the movie Shakespeare in Love more than an action movie.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1221,Michael,"It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1221,Toby,"All right Michael, but Oscar's really gay.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1221,Michael,Exactly!,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1221,Toby,I mean for real.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1221,Michael,"Yeah, I know.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1221,Toby,"No, I mean he's attracted to other men.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1221,Michael,"OK, a little too far, crossed the line.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1221,Toby,"OK, I am telling you, Oscar is an actual homosexual. Yeah, he told me this morning. And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1222,Michael,"I would have never called him that if I knew. You don't... You don't call retarded people ""retards"". It's bad taste. You call your friends ""retards"" when they're acting retarded. And I consider Oscar a friend.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1223,Michael,"Listen man, I am so sorry. I had no idea.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1223,Oscar,"No, it's fine.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1223,Michael,"No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people ""faggie"" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1223,Oscar,"That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1224,Angela, It explains so much.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1225,Oscar,"No, I'm not gay. And I don't understand why anyone would think, that I'm gay... if...  Uh... yeah I'm gay.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1226,Jim,"I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1227,Jim,Why did I transfer to Stamford? I think that's pretty obvious. I got promoted! And you can't beat that view... right?,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1228,Andy,"Hey, Big Tuna! You're single right?",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1228,Jim,"Uh-huh, yeah. I am.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1228,Andy,She's pretty hot huh?  She's completely crazy. Steer clear Big Tuna. Head for open waters.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1228,Jim,OooOK.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1228,Andy,OooOK.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1229,Jim,"I ate a tuna sandwich, on my first day. So, Andy started calling me Big Tuna. ...I don't think any of them actually know my real name.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1230,Andy,"Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know? Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him. I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?  I graduated in four years. I never studied once. I was drunk the whole time, and I sang in the acappella group, ""Here Comes Treble.""",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1231,Josh,"So, end of day we are going to have a little diversity policy refresher, because of some more problems at the Scranton branch. And I have a list of business startups I got from the chamber. Yes, I am going to need someone to cold call them.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1231,Jim,"Oh, I can do that.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1232,Karen,Jim's nice enough. I dont... I don't know how well he's fitting in here. He's always looking at the camera like this.  What is that?,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1233,Michael,Can you tell who's gay and who's not?,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1233,Dwight,Of course.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1233,Michael,What about Oscar?,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1233,Dwight,Absolutely not.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1233,Dwight,"Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1233,Michael, There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1233,Dwight,"You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1233,Michael,"Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1234,Michael,"Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1234,Dwight,I really don't think so.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1234,Michael,"I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1235,Michael,Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1235,Dwight,Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1235,Michael,That's ridiculous.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1235,Dwight,Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1235,Michael, Let's call him and get the website.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1235,Dwight,Definitely.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1236,Michael,"Well, they're sold out.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1236,Dwight,Damn.  I'll try Brookstone.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1237,Jim,I miss that.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1238,Roy,Chicken or fish?,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1238,Pam, Chicken.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1238,Roy,So you havin' a good day?,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1238,Pam,"Excellent, thanks.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1238,Roy,"Good, glad. OK.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1239,Pam,"Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food. So we froze it. But I'm, I'm doing well. I have my own apartment. I'm taking art classes. And I have lunch for the next five weeks.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1240,Roy,"After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest. I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted. I gotta win her back.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1241,Stanley,"I got them a toaster. They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me. I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster. So now my house has got two toasters.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1242,Kelly,That is so cool that you're gay. I totally underestimated you.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1243,Oscar,"Yes I'm super cool. I am an accountant at a failing paper supply company, Scranton. Much like, um, sir Ian McClellan.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1244,Angela,"Sure, sometimes I watch Will and Grace... and I want to throw up. It's terribly loud. I do like it sometimes when Harry Connick Jr. is on. He's so talented.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1245,Andy,"OK. Who put my calculator in Jello? Good one. But uh, seriously, guys who did this? Seriously guys, who did this? I need to know who put my calculator in Jello, or I'm gonna lose MY FRICKIN' MIND!",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Jan,"You know, it's amazing to me that in this day and age, you could be so obtuse about sexual orientation.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Michael,"I watch the L Word. I watch, Queer as F***, so...",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Jan,That's not what it's called.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Toby,"OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Michael,What? What does that even...,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Jan,"Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Michael,"Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay... shame festival.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Toby,"All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Michael,I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about?,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Jan,NO!,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Michael,I don't kn--,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Jan,"No, it's not possible.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Michael,Anything's possible.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Jan,"You know, imagine... you were gay.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Michael," Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1246,Jan,"Michael, your immaturity is extremely disappointing and may even lead to a lawsuit which is the absolute last thing this company needs right now. Do you understand?",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1247,Michael,"The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1248,Oscar,Am I the first gay man you ever knew?,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1248,Michael,"Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer?",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1249,Pam,"Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1249,Dwight,"Uh, Michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1250,Michael," Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay p0rn, straight p0rn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1251,Dwight,Ah damn pop-ups.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1251,Oscar,What are you doing?!,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1251,Angela,Watching some of your friends.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1252,Michael," All right, everybody in the conference room! I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight! JUST GET IN HERE! RIGHT NOW!",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1253,Michael,"Did you know that gay used to mean happy? When I was growing up it meant lame. And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1254,Michael,"We're all homos! Homosapiens. Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people. I mean anybody could be gay. Business-men. Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants. Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here. However you want to do it. Go ahead. Stand up. I'm doing this for you.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1254,Oscar,"Yes I'm gay. And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever. Can I sit down now?",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1255,Creed,"/b]: I'm not offended by homosexuality. In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain. And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1256,Michael,Who should be the judges and juries of our society?,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1256,Angela,Judges and juries!,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1256,Michael,"Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey s*x as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right?",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1256,Kevin,/b]: That sounds great.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1257,Dwight,"I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1257,Oscar,No one else in this office is gay.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1257,Dwight,What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1257,Phyllis,I'm getting married to Bob Vance.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1257,Michael,"That's great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  See? Everybody has a chance!",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1258,Michael,"But still, Phyllis, in college? Did you ever experiment with other women? A lot of women do!",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1258,Phyllis,"No, you knew me in high school. Course, we all thought you were gay in high school.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1258,Michael, Right!  And I take that as a compliment.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1258,Phyllis,Well with your ties and your matching socks and ---,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1258,Michael,"Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1258,Oscar,You sound pretty defensive Michael.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1258,Michael,"No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero!",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1259,Michael,"Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen. I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1259,Oscar,"I don't think I can work here any longer. This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1259,Michael,"You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend ---",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1259,Oscar,I would rather not.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1259,Michael,"...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1260,Oscar,"No, NO! I don't want to touch you, ever consider that? You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1260,Michael,"All right, um... sorry.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1260,Oscar,"Michael... I'm sorry. That was a good idea. Come on, come on. ",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1260,Michael, I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1261,Dwight,Michael appears to be gay too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend.,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1262,Michael,"You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes. I want you to watch this. And I want you to burn this into your brains. Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come. Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.  I did it. See. I'm still here. We're all still here. ",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1262,Michael," Oh come on! Dwight! Come on, man!",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1263,Michael,"We are not in the playground anymore. There are new rules. We have to be mature. But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder. What is love... anyway? Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules. Like me and Jan. Or Oscar... and some guy. Life is short. When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1264,Michael,"I am glad that today spurred social change. That's part of my job as regional manager. But you know what? Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed. ...that's what she said. Or he said.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1265,Michael,"Oh, there's Gill. Oscar's roommate. I wonder if he knows?",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1266,Oscar,"I was going to quit. But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1267,Dwight," ""Hope this helps. -Jim"" Nice!",
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1268,Oscar, What are you doing?!,
3,1,Gay Witch Hunt,1268,Dwight,Shhh. Don't be scared.  It works.  ...oh no.,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,Pam?,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,Yeah?,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,Did you see Oprah yesterday?,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,"No, I didn't.",
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,"I, uh... I am going to be a father.",
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,What was Oprah about?,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,"Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.",
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,That's a really big decision.,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,I know.,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,Maybe you should wait before you adopt.,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,Well...,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,Or not adopt.,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,"Just do it, okay?",
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,"Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.",
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,"Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?",
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,"You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.",
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,Eight months?,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,Yeah.,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months.,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,You probably won't.,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,"You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby...",
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,"No, Michael.",
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,Twenty years.,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,"No, Michael.",
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,Thirty.,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Pam,Sure.,
3,2,The Convention,1269,Michael,It's a deal.,
3,2,The Convention,1270,Ryan,All right. Three pairs of pants. Three pairs of socks. Three packs of condoms.,
3,2,The Convention,1270,Michael,Yesh.,
3,2,The Convention,1270,Ryan,"Uh, fun jeans.",
3,2,The Convention,1270,Michael,Right there. Ah.,
3,2,The Convention,1270,Angela,Sign.,
3,2,The Convention,1270,Michael,Per diem.,
3,2,The Convention,1271,Michael,"Guess where I am going. I will give you a hint. It is a booze-fueled s*x romp, where anything goes. You are correct, sir! I am headed to Philadelphia for the Annual Northeastern Mid-Market Office Supply Convention. And Jim Halpert is going to be coming, which will be fun. Poor little guy. He's been stuck working under Josh, the poor man's Michael Scott, as he is known around my condo.",
3,2,The Convention,1272,Dwight,"Don't be mad, it is a business trip.",
3,2,The Convention,1272,Angela,But I don't understand. It's for managers.,
3,2,The Convention,1272,Dwight,"Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.",
3,2,The Convention,1272,Angela,I know! It... I was just really hoping we could spend some time together.  Are you still there?,
3,2,The Convention,1272,Dwight,"Yes, Monkey.",
3,2,The Convention,1272,Angela,"Don't ""Monkey"" me! You can't wait to get out of here, A. R. M.",
3,2,The Convention,1273,Angela,"In the Martin family, we like to say, ""Looks like someone took the slow train from Philly."" That's code for ""check out the slut."" What is... why are there flies in here?",
3,2,The Convention,1274,Kelly,"Oh my God! Are you so excited for tonight? I am so excited. You guys are going to click, I can feel it. So what are you wearing?",
3,2,The Convention,1274,Pam,This.,
3,2,The Convention,1274,Kelly,You look so pretty.,
3,2,The Convention,1274,Pam,Thank you.,
3,2,The Convention,1275,Pam,"Yes, I have a date. He's a cartoonist for the local paper, which is really neat, because I like to draw too. I'm kind of nervous. I haven't been on a first date in nine years... probably shouldn't broadcast that.",
3,2,The Convention,1276,Kelly,"Well, remember, no matter how much you may want to, do not sleep with him on the first date. It gives him all the power.",
3,2,The Convention,1276,Michael,"Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?",
3,2,The Convention,1276,Kelly,My neighbor Alan. They're going on a date tonight.,
3,2,The Convention,1276,Michael,"Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.",
3,2,The Convention,1276,Dwight,And your veil.,
3,2,The Convention,1276,Michael,"Yeah, do it!",
3,2,The Convention,1276,Pam,I'll probably just wear this.,
3,2,The Convention,1276,Michael,"Really? Okay. Well, word of advice: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?",
3,2,The Convention,1276,Pam,Um...,
3,2,The Convention,1276,Michael,"Um. Okay, um.",
3,2,The Convention,1276,Dwight,Um.,
3,2,The Convention,1276,Michael,You got that?,

3,2,The Convention,1280,Michael,"I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.",
3,2,The Convention,1281,Jim,"It's really good to see you, man.",
3,2,The Convention,1281,Michael,"Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!",

3,2,The Convention,1281,Dwight,"Well, I did it too.",
3,2,The Convention,1282,Jim,"You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.",
3,2,The Convention,1283,Kevin,So did you hear?,
3,2,The Convention,1283,Toby,What?,
3,2,The Convention,1283,Kevin,Pam's back on the market again.,
3,2,The Convention,1283,Toby,Really? She's dating?,
3,2,The Convention,1283,Kevin,"If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.",
3,2,The Convention,1284,Dwight,So what kind of commissions you get up there?,
3,2,The Convention,1284,Jim,"Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.",
3,2,The Convention,1284,Dwight,You're so immature!,
3,2,The Convention,1285,Josh,"Listen, Michael, I heard you were a great salesman.",
3,2,The Convention,1285,Michael,Ah.,
3,2,The Convention,1285,Josh,"And I just want to let you know that if our branch absorbs your branch, I'm going to look for a place for you at Stamford.",
3,2,The Convention,1285,Jan,"Oh, hey!",
3,2,The Convention,1285,Dwight,"Hey, Jan.",
3,2,The Convention,1285,Jan,We all checked in?,
3,2,The Convention,1285,Josh,Yes.,
3,2,The Convention,1285,Jan,"Great, let's dump our stuff and meet back here in half an hour.",
3,2,The Convention,1285,Josh,Okay.,
3,2,The Convention,1285,Jan,Okay!,
3,2,The Convention,1285,Michael,"Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.",
3,2,The Convention,1285,Jan,What are you talking about?,
3,2,The Convention,1285,Michael,"The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.",
3,2,The Convention,1285,Jan,"Step away from me, Michael.",
3,2,The Convention,1285,Michael,Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.,
3,2,The Convention,1286,Kelly,"Alan's cartoon is so funny, right?",
3,2,The Convention,1286,Pam,Mm-hmm.,
3,2,The Convention,1286,Kelly,"And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.",
3,2,The Convention,1287,Dwight,This party is going to be awesome.,
3,2,The Convention,1287,Michael,I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.,
3,2,The Convention,1287,Dwight,Check it out.,
3,2,The Convention,1287,Michael,That is crooked on that side.,
3,2,The Convention,1287,Dwight,Wow.,
3,2,The Convention,1287,Michael,Hey hey!,
3,2,The Convention,1287,Jim,That is a lot of liquor.,
3,2,The Convention,1287,Michael,Yeah.,
3,2,The Convention,1287,Jim,And a dart board.,
3,2,The Convention,1287,Michael,"Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop.",
3,2,The Convention,1287,Josh,We should probably head on down and hook up with Jan.,
3,2,The Convention,1287,Michael,"Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?",
3,2,The Convention,1287,Josh,"A shot of MIDORI, perhaps.",
3,2,The Convention,1287,Jim,"Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.",
3,2,The Convention,1287,Michael,Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.,
3,2,The Convention,1287,Josh,"Um, we should...",
3,2,The Convention,1287,Jim,Yeah.,
3,2,The Convention,1287,Michael,"All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.",
3,2,The Convention,1287,Dwight,"I'll do a shot, Michael.",
3,2,The Convention,1287,Michael,"Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.",
3,2,The Convention,1288,Michael,SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.,
3,2,The Convention,1289,Michael,"Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.",
3,2,The Convention,1289,Dwight,"Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.",
3,2,The Convention,1289,Jerome Bettis,All right.,
3,2,The Convention,1289,Dwight,I'm a huge fan.,
3,2,The Convention,1289,Jerome Bettis,"Thanks. I appreciate it, guys.",
3,2,The Convention,1289,Michael,"You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.",
3,2,The Convention,1289,Jerome Bettis,"All right, maybe. If I can.",
3,2,The Convention,1289,Michael,"Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?",
3,2,The Convention,1289,Jerome Bettis,"No, you cannot.",
3,2,The Convention,1289,Michael,So maybe. See ya.,
3,2,The Convention,1289,Dwight,Why do they call him The Bus?,
3,2,The Convention,1289,Michael,Because he's afraid to fly.,
3,2,The Convention,1290,Dwight,Smile!,
3,2,The Convention,1290,Michael,"Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!",
3,2,The Convention,1291,Josh,"All right, Jan just emailed me. She wants us to meet her up front.",
3,2,The Convention,1291,Michael,"Yep. Yeah, she's up front.",
3,2,The Convention,1291,Dwight,You don't have email on your phone.,
3,2,The Convention,1291,Michael,"I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?",
3,2,The Convention,1291,Dwight,No one just called you.,
3,2,The Convention,1291,Josh,All right.,
3,2,The Convention,1291,Jim,"All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.",
3,2,The Convention,1291,Ted,I'll see you soon.,
3,2,The Convention,1291,Josh,"Yeah, stop by later.",
3,2,The Convention,1291,Michael, See you in a bit. Bye-bye.  May I have a moment of your time please?,
3,2,The Convention,1292,Michael,I need you to do something for me.,
3,2,The Convention,1292,Dwight,Yes. Anything.,
3,2,The Convention,1292,Michael,I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.,
3,2,The Convention,1292,Dwight,"I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.",
3,2,The Convention,1293,Toby,"Hey, Pam.",
3,2,The Convention,1293,Pam,Hey! What's up?,
3,2,The Convention,1293,Toby,"It's, uh... I was... might ask if you wanted...",
3,2,The Convention,1293,Pam," Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too.  Sorry. What's up?",
3,2,The Convention,1293,Toby,"Um, if, uh... um... I just completely forgot what I was going to say. It's so weird.",
3,2,The Convention,1293,Pam,"Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here.",
3,2,The Convention,1293,Toby,Okay.,
3,2,The Convention,1294,Dwight,"So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.",
3,2,The Convention,1294,Michael,And?,
3,2,The Convention,1294,Dwight,He wasn't volunteering today.,
3,2,The Convention,1295,Michael,Business has been pretty crazy around the office.,
3,2,The Convention,1295,Jim,Oh yeah?,
3,2,The Convention,1295,Michael,Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.,
3,2,The Convention,1295,Jim,"Oh, tell him I say hi.",
3,2,The Convention,1295,Michael,I will call him later with that message.,
3,2,The Convention,1295,Jim,"Hey, how is... Toby?",
3,2,The Convention,1295,Michael,Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?,
3,2,The Convention,1295,Jim,"Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...",
3,2,The Convention,1295,Michael,"Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.",
3,2,The Convention,1295,Jim,"Michael, it's really not a competition.",
3,2,The Convention,1296,Josh,Jim got us a great lead with a new rep from National Envelope. We can grab lunch with them tomorrow.,
3,2,The Convention,1296,Jan,Great!,
3,2,The Convention,1296,Michael,"Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.",
3,2,The Convention,1296,Dwight,Whoa. Michael.,
3,2,The Convention,1296,Waiter,"Wow, oh my God, thank you.",
3,2,The Convention,1296,Michael,You're welcome.,
3,2,The Convention,1296,Dwight,Was that your per diem?,
3,2,The Convention,1296,Michael,"No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.",
3,2,The Convention,1296,Jan,"What have you generated, Michael?",
3,2,The Convention,1296,Michael,I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.,
3,2,The Convention,1296,Jan,What party?,
3,2,The Convention,1296,Michael,"The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.",
3,2,The Convention,1296,Jan,"Michael, um... Jim and Josh are in meetings all day. And I am in and out of meetings. I can't stay on top of you 24/7.",
3,2,The Convention,1297,Phyllis,"You should order the most expensive thing on the menu, so he knows you're worth it.",
3,2,The Convention,1297,Stanley,"If you do that, you're going to have to put out.",
3,2,The Convention,1297,Phyllis,"Oh, yeah. You'll have to put out.",
3,2,The Convention,1298,Angela,Is there a key for Jane Doe? Thank you.,

3,2,The Convention,1299,Dwight,"Hey, Michael.",
3,2,The Convention,1299,Michael,What's up?,
3,2,The Convention,1299,Josh,"Well, Jim and I have a meeting with Uni-ball in about forty-five minutes, so we should probably go now.",
3,2,The Convention,1299,Michael,"Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.",
3,2,The Convention,1299,Josh,I don't think so.,
3,2,The Convention,1299,Michael,"Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.",
3,2,The Convention,1299,Josh,Fine! All right.,
3,2,The Convention,1299,Michael,Okay! Excellent. Oh...,
3,2,The Convention,1299,Dwight,Keep the wing flaps.,
3,2,The Convention,1299,Michael,"Shut it.  Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes.  Say hi to Pam!",
3,2,The Convention,1299,"Jim, Josh, and Dwight","Hi, Pam.",
3,2,The Convention,1299,Michael,"Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim.  Pam says hi.  Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.",
3,2,The Convention,1300,Michael,You first.,
3,2,The Convention,1300,Dwight,"Come on. Nice try, Josh!",
3,2,The Convention,1300,Michael,"Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.",
3,2,The Convention,1300,Josh,"Or what? We didn't bet anything, Michael.",
3,2,The Convention,1300,Michael,"Well, let's...",

3,2,The Convention,1300,Josh,We gotta go.,
3,2,The Convention,1300,Michael,Come on!,
3,2,The Convention,1300,Josh,Uh... we'll do it later.,
3,2,The Convention,1300,Evan,"Say, while I have you here, could I talk to you about some new and exciting advances to our product line?",
3,2,The Convention,1300,Michael,Fine.,
3,2,The Convention,1301,Michael,"Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.",
3,2,The Convention,1301,Evan,That is so true. Ready?,
3,2,The Convention,1301,Michael,"Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.",
3,2,The Convention,1301,Evan,Great.,
3,2,The Convention,1302,Michael,"Sorry, my meeting ran late.",
3,2,The Convention,1302,Jan,Really?,
3,2,The Convention,1302,Michael,"Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.",
3,2,The Convention,1302,Josh,They're exclusive with Staples.,
3,2,The Convention,1302,Michael,Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.,

3,2,The Convention,1302,Jan,"Well, Michael, I underestimated you.",
3,2,The Convention,1302,Michael,"Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.",
3,2,The Convention,1303,Jim,Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.,
3,2,The Convention,1303,Angela,D?,
3,2,The Convention,1303,Jim,"Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!",
3,2,The Convention,1304,Kelly,"So, Alan, Pam is obsessed with your cartoons. She reads them every day.",

3,2,The Convention,1304,Ryan,I don't want ketchup.,
3,2,The Convention,1304,Kelly,You love ketchup! He loves ketchup.,
3,2,The Convention,1304,Pam,So how do you come up with your cartoons?,
3,2,The Convention,1304,Alan,"Well, I just, uh... I kinda think about stuff that I see, or dream them.",
3,2,The Convention,1304,Pam,You dream in cartoons? How fun!,
3,2,The Convention,1305,Michael,"Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.",
3,2,The Convention,1305,Guy,I thought there was a party in here.,
3,2,The Convention,1305,Michael,This is the party.,

3,2,The Convention,1306,Alan,"See, this one is great, because it can work on a couple of different levels.",
3,2,The Convention,1306,Pam,Huh.,
3,2,The Convention,1306,Alan, Freedom fries for the table.,
3,2,The Convention,1306,Pam,Freedom fries. Yeah.,
3,2,The Convention,1306,Alan,"Yeah. I mean, people always say, like, ""Don't be edgy."" But I don't know any other way. Yeah, you get it.",
3,2,The Convention,1307,Pam,"Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.",
3,2,The Convention,1307,Alan,"Yeah. Next time bring some of your illustrations, I'll let you pick my brain.",
3,2,The Convention,1307,Pam,More freedom fries.,
3,2,The Convention,1307,Alan,Yeah.,
3,2,The Convention,1307,Pam,That's great.,
3,2,The Convention,1307,Alan,Okay.,
3,2,The Convention,1308,Pam,"I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.",
3,2,The Convention,1309,Jim,Michael. Am I the first to arrive?,
3,2,The Convention,1309,Michael,People have been filtering in and out.,
3,2,The Convention,1309,Jim,Can I get a drink?,
3,2,The Convention,1309,Michael,What?,
3,2,The Convention,1309,Jim,Can I get a drink?,

3,2,The Convention,1309,Jim,Yeah.,
3,2,The Convention,1309,Michael,"Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?",
3,2,The Convention,1309,Jim,Michael...,
3,2,The Convention,1309,Michael,"I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...",
3,2,The Convention,1309,Jim,"Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.",
3,2,The Convention,1309,Michael,I'm not better than Josh.,
3,2,The Convention,1309,Jim,"Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.",
3,2,The Convention,1309,Michael,Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.,
3,2,The Convention,1309,Jim,"No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.",
3,2,The Convention,1309,Michael,"I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.",
3,2,The Convention,1309,Jim,"Nope, that's okay.",

3,2,The Convention,1309,Jim,"No, we used to. Now we're friends.",
3,2,The Convention,1309,Michael,Best friends.,
3,2,The Convention,1310,Michael,"Some people need dozens of friends to say, ""Hey, look at me, I'm popular."" But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.",
3,2,The Convention,1311,Michael,"Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir?  Ha, ha, ha.",
3,2,The Convention,1311,Dwight,"Ha, ha, ha, ha.",

3,3,The Coup,1314,Pam, Anyone else? Nooo.,
3,3,The Coup,1315,Pam,"Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast. Then we watched a medical video. Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.",
3,3,The Coup,1316,Michael,Entourage!,
3,3,The Coup,1317,Michael,"Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?",

3,3,The Coup,1324,Jan,Magically?,
3,3,The Coup,1324,Michael,No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.,
3,3,The Coup,1324,Jan,No.,
3,3,The Coup,1325,Angela, Kitchen.,
3,3,The Coup,1326,Angela,"Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.",
3,3,The Coup,1326,Dwight,That's not going to happen.,
3,3,The Coup,1326,Angela,You know she has it out for him now.,
3,3,The Coup,1326,Dwight,That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart!,
3,3,The Coup,1327,Dwight,"Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms.",
3,3,The Coup,1328,Angela,"Dwight, you should be running this office.",
3,3,The Coup,1328,Dwight,Michael would never let me...,

3,3,The Coup,1330,Jim,"At the Stamford branch, they all play this World War II video game called Call of Duty, and they're all really into it. I'm told it started as a team building exercise. Unfortunately I really suck at it. We didn't play many video games in Scranton. Instead we'd do stuff like, uh, Pam and I would sometimes hum the same high pitched note, and try to get Dwight to make an appointment with an ear doctor. And uh, Pam called it... Pretendenitus.",
3,3,The Coup,1331,Pam," Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. ",
3,3,The Coup,1332,Pam,"Kelly really likes to online shop. Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes. I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.",

3,3,The Coup,1336,Jan,"You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.",
3,3,The Coup,1336,Dwight,It's about Michael.,
3,3,The Coup,1336,Jan,What about him?,
3,3,The Coup,1336,Dwight, I can't talk here. It's too sensitive.,
3,3,The Coup,1336,Jan,It's not about a surprise party is it?,
3,3,The Coup,1336,Dwight,"No, but we should discuss that another time.",
3,3,The Coup,1336,Jan,"Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.",
3,3,The Coup,1336,Dwight,"Pull over at exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.",
3,3,The Coup,1336,Jan,How do you know I like that store?,
3,3,The Coup,1336,Dwight,Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.,

3,3,The Coup,1336,Dwight,Part of my job.,
3,3,The Coup,1336,Jan,No it's not. It's officially not.,

3,3,The Coup,1339,Dwight,Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house.  Right here. It's all for me. Thank you.,
3,3,The Coup,1339,Jan,"Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.",
3,3,The Coup,1339,Dwight,"The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So , here we are. It's all, on the table. I want... the branch. And I await your decision.",
3,3,The Coup,1340,Dwight," Oh, by the way. There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings.",

3,3,The Coup,1341,Michael,Oh. That's nice.,

3,3,The Coup,1341,Michael,...what?,
3,3,The Coup,1341,Jan,Mm-hmm.,
3,3,The Coup,1341,Michael,...you were at the dentist?,
3,3,The Coup,1341,Jan,You can't have people undermining you. Get control of your branch immediately.,
3,3,The Coup,1341,Michael,Ok.,
3,3,The Coup,1342,Michael,What was Dwight thinking? That he could turn Jan against me? She's my ex-lover! ...ish.,
3,3,The Coup,1343,Phyllis, Woooooow.,
3,3,The Coup,1343,Phyllis,It's really something.,
3,3,The Coup,1343,Pam, It's too much.,

3,3,The Coup,1347,Andy,Put the game on hold everyone.,
3,3,The Coup,1348,Josh,"This is not working, ok? We are getting slaughtered out there.",
3,3,The Coup,1348,Andy,It's the new guy. ,
3,3,The Coup,1348,Jim,"Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...",
3,3,The Coup,1348,Andy,See what I mean?,
3,3,The Coup,1348,Josh,"We just need a strategy, ok? We're going to set up a trap in the gun room. All right Jim, are you using the MP-40 or the 44?",
3,3,The Coup,1348,Jim,"Um, sniper rifle?",

3,3,The Coup,1349,Dwight,...ok. ,

3,3,The Coup,1349,Dwight,...so good.,
3,3,The Coup,1349,Michael,Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.,
3,3,The Coup,1349,Dwight,"They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...",
3,3,The Coup,1349,Michael,Sounds like a good dentist.,
3,3,The Coup,1349,Dwight,"Oh, yeah.",
3,3,The Coup,1349,Michael,What's his name?,

3,3,The Coup,1350,Michael, Well then... I am glad you're ok.,
3,3,The Coup,1351,Michael,"Business is like a jungle. And I... am like a tiger. And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick. Does the tiger fire the monkey? Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?  Pun. There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head. We don't have the technology.",
3,3,The Coup,1352,Michael,"Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?",

3,3,The Coup,1353,Dwight,I can't believe this news. That--- wow.,
3,3,The Coup,1353,Michael,I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally.,

3,3,The Coup,1355,Michael,"Hey, hi, hello. Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news. I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.",

3,3,The Coup,1355,Angela,Congratulations Dwight.,
3,3,The Coup,1355,Dwight,Thank you Angela.,
3,3,The Coup,1355,Stanley,But... why Dwight?,
3,3,The Coup,1355,Michael,"Because, Dwight... never lies.",
3,3,The Coup,1355,Stanley,How does that qualify him to run a branch?,
3,3,The Coup,1355,Michael,Because that's all it takes.,
3,3,The Coup,1356,Michael,"Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?",
3,3,The Coup,1356,Dwight,"Thank you Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black! With ferocity!",

3,3,The Coup,1360,Dwight,Yes.,
3,3,The Coup,1360,Angela,We can make a difference here.,
3,3,The Coup,1360,Angela,You alone? Because I thought together we could---,
3,3,The Coup,1360,Dwight,"Oh please, don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women.",
3,3,The Coup,1361,Karen, Look how cute he is! He's trying to shoot with a smoke grenade.,
3,3,The Coup,1361,Jim,I'm sorry what are you whispering about?,

3,3,The Coup,1364,Michael,"Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.",
3,3,The Coup,1364,Dwight, No thank you.,

3,3,The Coup,1364,Dwight,Not my style.,
3,3,The Coup,1364,Michael,But you said you liked it. You've always admired it.,
3,3,The Coup,1364,Dwight,"Well that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.",
3,3,The Coup,1364,Michael, Take it back.,
3,3,The Coup,1364,Dwight, No.,
3,3,The Coup,1364,Michael,That's my car.,
3,3,The Coup,1364,Dwight,What did you---,
3,3,The Coup,1364,Michael,THAT'S MY CAR.,

3,3,The Coup,1365,Dwight, Don't fire me. Please.,

3,3,The Coup,1365,Michael,I don't know if I can trust you anymore.,
3,3,The Coup,1365,Dwight,"You can't. You can't. But I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael. What can I do?  What can I do?  What can I do? What can I do?",
3,3,The Coup,1365,Michael,"You can get up. Get up.  And you can hug it out, bitch. ",
3,3,The Coup,1366,Michael,"Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate.",
3,3,The Coup,1367,Michael,"Yep. Yeah, we hugged it out. But, it turns out, I was still a little angry. So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more,  and I'm making him do my laundry for a year.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1368,Michael,"Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?",

3,4,Grief Counseling,1372,Michael,"Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1372,Phyllis,That's a shame. Ed was a good guy.,

3,4,Grief Counseling,1375,Karen, Dammit.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1375,Jim,What's up?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1375,Karen,"Uh, nothing. They're just out of Herr's chips.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1375,Jim,Oh.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1375,Karen,But don't worry about it. My snack food doesn't fall under the umbrella of your authority.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1375,Jim,"Mmm, that's where you're wrong. I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require. So, I think we should go get some. Now, please.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Creed,"It's a real shame about Ed, huh?",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Michael,Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Creed,About what?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Michael,"The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Creed,Ed was decapitated.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Michael,What?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Dwight,Really?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Creed,"He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6. He slides under an 18 wheeler. Pop. It snaps right off.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Michael,Oh my God.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Dwight,That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Creed,You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Dwight,You're thinking of a chicken.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1376,Creed,What did I say?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1377,Michael,"That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry. Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1378,Michael," So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1378,Dwight,Ed was decapitated.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1378,Michael,What are you doing?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1378,Dwight,You said you didn't know how to say it.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1378,Michael,I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1379,Dwight,Hey.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1379,Angela,Hi.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1379,Dwight,"If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1379,Angela,I do not wanna talk about this.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1380,Dwight,"When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,"I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Jan," I understand how you feel, Michael. I really do. So, would it be helpful to give everyone the day off?",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,"You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Jan,"Well, what would you suggest?",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael, A statue.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Jan,Of Ed?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,Yeah.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Jan, I'm not sure that's realistic.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,"Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Jan,"No, that's not---",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,"We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Dwight,"That is not a statue, that is a robot.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,I think that is a great way to honor Ed.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Dwight,And how big do you want this robot?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,Life-size.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Dwight,"Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Jan,What the hell are you two talking about?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,"Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Jan,"You know what, Michael? I've really tried with you today...",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,Mm hm.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Jan,...and I have to get back to work.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Jan,So call me when you feel like having a real conversation.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,But Ed truck can't because he is---,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Jan,Goodbye. ,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,DEAD.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Dwight,Look  I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1381,Michael,That's perfect.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Jim,"Okay, that is a ""no"" on the on the West Side Market.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Karen,"Okay, great. I think that's enough. Can I get back to work now?",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Jim,Wow. Never pegged you for a quitter.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Karen,I am NOT a quitter. I will do this all day if you want.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Jim,Really?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Karen,"Yeah, all day.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Andy,Hey. What are we doing? What's the game? I want in.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Jim,"Oh, there's no game. We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Andy,Did you check the vending machine?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Karen,"Oh, the vending machines! How did we miss that?",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Jim,I have no idea. We went right for the copier.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Karen,Mm.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Jim,And then we checked the fax machine.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Karen,"Yeah, nothing there.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1382,Andy,Did you check your... butt?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1383,Michael,"Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was? If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception. Probably get on Pam.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1383,Phyllis,Okay that's enough.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1383,Michael,What?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1383,Stanley,We do not wanna hear about this.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1383,Michael,"Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head!",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1383,Stanley,You have just spit on my face.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1383,Michael,"Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1384,Michael,"There are five stages to grief, which are  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad. And that's hard. And it's making them all angry. And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance. And if not acceptance, then just depression. If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1385,Michael,"I am going to throw you this ball. When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged. Let me just start. Let me show you how this works. I catch the ball. I lost Ed Truck. And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1385,Roy,"Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt, uh, I need to see Pam. There seems to be, like, something wrong with the radiator in her car.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1385,Michael,"Okay, fine. Hurry back.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1385,Roy," There's nothing wrong with your car. I just thought you might like a break from the ""grief counseling"" session.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1385,Pam,Oh. I would like a break.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1386,Roy,How are you likin' the new car?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1386,Pam,Great.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1386,Roy,Yeah? Sure is small. Got airbags?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1386,Pam,"I think so. I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1386,Roy," Well, you're not still driving so fast, are you? Yeah.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1387,Jim," Hi, yeah. This is Mike from the West Side Market. Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah. You have 'em in the warehouse. Great. What is my store number... six. Wait, no. I'll call you back.  Shut up .",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1387,Karen, Six?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael," Okay, we can start. Um...",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Pam,You waited for me?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,"Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Dwight," I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,"Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Stanley, Nope.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael," Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Stanley,I will NOT. ,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Pam,"Let's see. I had an aunt that I was really close to. She was this amazing female boxer. Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,"Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Ryan," Thanks. Um, a few years ago, my family was on a safari in Africa and, um, my cousin, Mufasa was um, he was trampled to death by a pack of wildebeests and, um, we all... took it really hard. All of us kind of in the audience of what happened.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,Do you want to talk about it anymore?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Ryan,"Oh, it would probably take me like an hour and a half to tell that whole story.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Kevin,"Me, me, me, me, me me.  Yes. Okay, um. I was trying to throw this party once. And everyone was over for the weekend. And then my uncle Bernie died, and so me and my best friend, we had to pretend like he was alive, so...",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's.  Do you think that this is a game?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Phyllis,"Well, there is a ball.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,"All right, we're starting over.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Stanley,"No, I'm done.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,You are not leaving. No! We are not done.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Angela,We really have a lot of work to do right now.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,"Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk. ",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Toby,"Michael, look. I know this is hard for you, but death's just a part of life. I mean, just this morning I saw a little bird fly into the glass doors downstairs and die. And I had to keep going.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,How do you know?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Toby,What?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Toby,It was obvious...,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,"Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING! ",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Dwight,Michael!  Michael. Michael ...,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael," Oh, God!",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Dwight, Oh...,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,"Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ...",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Dwight,Poor little fella.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,Oh shhhh--oot!,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Dwight,He is a goner.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,"No, he's not.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Dwight,Yeah.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,"No, he's not. ",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Dwight,"Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria!",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1388,Michael,"Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1389,Angela,A dead bird should not be in the kitchen!,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1389,Michael,We don't know if it's dead.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1389,Dwight,You want me to flush him?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1390,Michael,Attention everybody. This will only take a second of your time. Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1390,Meredith,I have a lot of work to do.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1390,Michael,"Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird. And now we are going to honor it.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1390,Angela,But...,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1390,Michael,"No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now.  Find a box for him.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1391,Karen,I'm calling a supermarket in Montreal.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1391,Jim,Nice!,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1391,Karen, Bonjour. Je cherche des tchips de la marque Herr's. Non? Ah... merci quand meme. Au revoir.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1391,Jim,Sounded good.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1391,Karen,Thanks.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1392,Michael,"It's okay. It's okay.  Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1392,Kelly,"I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan  for him to know that we have a date tonight?",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1393,Dwight, Argh... gah!,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1393,Michael,What are... What are you doing?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1393,Dwight,"What? No, this is about the right size.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1393,Michael,"No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1394,Dwight,"I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum.  It would have fit if he had given me another minute.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1395,Dwight,I need a box. I need a box. A small box... not too confining.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1395,Pam,Is it for the bird?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1395,Dwight,Yeah.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1395,Pam,I have it covered. ,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1395,Dwight,"Oh, thank you.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1395,Pam,If you wanna do something for the funeral...,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1395,Dwight,"Yes, please.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1395,Pam,Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1395,Dwight,Excellent.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1395,Pam,Do you have it with you?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1395,Dwight,Always. ,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1396,Pam,Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral? You never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1397,Karen, Where'd you find them?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1397,Jim,Where'd I find what?,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1398,Jim,"I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1399,Michael,Glad you could all make it.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1399,Kelly,You told us we had to.,

3,4,Grief Counseling,1399,Pam,"Actually, I have it.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1399,Michael,You made this? Wow.  That's... that's very nice.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1400,Pam,I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1400,Michael,Yes.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1400,Pam,"What do we know about this bird? You might think, ""Not much. It's just a bird."" But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1400,Kevin,"Oh, I remember that. That was SO funny.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1400,Pam,"And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1400,Dwight,He's not a songbird.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1400,Michael,Shhh.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1400,Pam,"An impression, then. Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone. Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much. He will not be forgotten.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1400,Angela, Amen.,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1400,Pam, Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...,
3,4,Grief Counseling,1401,Michael,"Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.",
3,4,Grief Counseling,1402,Dwight,Let's get back to work.,
3,5,Initiation,1403,Dwight,Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?,
3,5,Initiation,1403,Ryan,A dime and a nickel.,
3,5,Initiation,1403,Dwight,"No, I said one of them is not a nickel.",
3,5,Initiation,1403,Ryan,But the other one is. I've heard that before.,
3,5,Initiation,1403,Dwight,"Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...",
3,5,Initiation,1403,Ryan,Because he's my son. The doctor is the boy's mother.,
3,5,Initiation,1403,Dwight,A man is found hanging from the ceiling...,
3,5,Initiation,1403,Ryan,"He stepped on a block of ice, hung himself, and the ice melted.",
3,5,Initiation,1403,Dwight,A hunter.,
3,5,Initiation,1403,Ryan,It's a polar bear because you're at the North Pole.,
3,5,Initiation,1403,Dwight,Damn it!,
3,5,Initiation,1404,Jan,Tell me what you did yesterday.,
3,5,Initiation,1404,Michael,Uhhh... nothing.,
3,5,Initiation,1404,Jan,Nothing?,
3,5,Initiation,1404,Michael,"Yeah, nothing. How was your day?",
3,5,Initiation,1404,Jan,I don't care how your day was Michael.,
3,5,Initiation,1404,Michael,"Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?",
3,5,Initiation,1404,Jan,Tell me what you did yesterday.,
3,5,Initiation,1404,Michael,I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had s*x. Is that what you want to hear?,
3,5,Initiation,1405,Michael,"Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.",
3,5,Initiation,1406,Jan,"Hi, Pam.",
3,5,Initiation,1406,Pam,Hi.,
3,5,Initiation,1406,Jan,"I'm great. So, Pam I would like you to keep a log of everything Michael does hour by hour so we can analyze it at corporate. Ok?",
3,5,Initiation,1406,Pam,"Oh, I don't know if I'm...",
3,5,Initiation,1406,Jan,Thanks Pam.,
3,5,Initiation,1407,Pam,"It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.",
3,5,Initiation,1408,Dwight,So you excited?,
3,5,Initiation,1408,Ryan,Yeah.,
3,5,Initiation,1408,Dwight,Very excited?,
3,5,Initiation,1408,Ryan,Yes. I'm very excited.,
3,5,Initiation,1408,Dwight,Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool.,
3,5,Initiation,1409,Ryan,"I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.",
3,5,Initiation,1410,Dwight,"I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?",
3,5,Initiation,1411,Ryan,"So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions?  So where's the sales office?",
3,5,Initiation,1411,Dwight,"When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.",
3,5,Initiation,1412,Karen, Hey.,
3,5,Initiation,1412,Jim,What?,
3,5,Initiation,1412,Karen,My chair is squeaking.,
3,5,Initiation,1412,Jim,Is it?,
3,5,Initiation,1412,Karen,You took my chair.,
3,5,Initiation,1412,Jim,"No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.",
3,5,Initiation,1412,Karen,"When you get up, I'm just going to take it back anyway, so...",
3,5,Initiation,1412,Jim,So I guess I can't get up.,
3,5,Initiation,1413,Michael,"Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.",
3,5,Initiation,1414,Dwight,"Do you know where we are, temp?",

3,5,Initiation,1415,Andy,"Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.",
3,5,Initiation,1415,Jim,Sure.,
3,5,Initiation,1415,Andy,Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?,
3,5,Initiation,1415,Karen,That's it? That's what you came up with?,
3,5,Initiation,1415,Andy,I'm acting my heart out here.,
3,5,Initiation,1415,Karen,Really?,
3,5,Initiation,1415,Andy,"Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.",
3,5,Initiation,1416,Announcer,"Attention Scranton Business Park, there will be complimentary pretzels in the lobby from now until 4 o'clock as a thank you to our loyal tenants.",
3,5,Initiation,1417,Pam,Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.,
3,5,Initiation,1418,Michael,"Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.",
3,5,Initiation,1419,Michael," Oh, shhh... Come on.",
3,5,Initiation,1420,Dwight,"And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.",
3,5,Initiation,1420,Ryan,I don't think you know what you're saying.,
3,5,Initiation,1420,Dwight,"Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?",
3,5,Initiation,1420,Ryan,Uh huh.,
3,5,Initiation,1420,Dwight,It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.,
3,5,Initiation,1420,Ryan,Gotcha.,

3,5,Initiation,1426,Michael,"No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.",
3,5,Initiation,1426,Pam,Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.,
3,5,Initiation,1426,Michael,I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.,
3,5,Initiation,1426,Pam,"Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.",
3,5,Initiation,1426,Michael,"Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.",
3,5,Initiation,1426,Pam,"You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.",
3,5,Initiation,1426,Michael,"Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.",
3,5,Initiation,1427,Dwight,It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.,
3,5,Initiation,1427,Ryan,"Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.",
3,5,Initiation,1427,Dwight,You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?,
3,5,Initiation,1427,Ryan,Yeah.,
3,5,Initiation,1427,Dwight,Come on!,
3,5,Initiation,1428,Stanley,Thank you! ,
3,5,Initiation,1428,Michael,Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.,
3,5,Initiation,1428,Pretzel guy,We do.,
3,5,Initiation,1428,Michael,Thank God.,
3,5,Initiation,1428,Pretzel guy,"And we have 18 different toppings. We have sweet glaze, cinnamon sugar, chocolate, white chocolate, fudge, M&M's, caramel dip, mint chip, chocolate chip, marshmallow, nuts, toffee nuts, coconuts, peanut butter drizzle, Oreos, sprinkles, cotton candy bits, and powdered sugar.",
3,5,Initiation,1428,Michael,"Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?",
3,5,Initiation,1428,Pretzel guy,The Works. You got it.,
3,5,Initiation,1428,Michael,All right! Thank you!,
3,5,Initiation,1429,Dwight,Please be seated. ,
3,5,Initiation,1429,Ryan,Who was that?,
3,5,Initiation,1429,Dwight,Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.,
3,5,Initiation,1429,Ryan,Is that your Cousin Mose?,
3,5,Initiation,1429,Dwight,Yes.,
3,5,Initiation,1430,Dwight,"Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.",
3,5,Initiation,1431,Dwight,What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?,
3,5,Initiation,1431,Ryan,Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.,
3,5,Initiation,1431,Dwight,Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?,
3,5,Initiation,1431,Ryan,Depression?,
3,5,Initiation,1431,Dwight,Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?,
3,5,Initiation,1432,Kelly,I can't believe that Ryan is not back yet. Where could they be?,
3,5,Initiation,1432,Angela,Sales take a long time.,
3,5,Initiation,1432,Kelly,"Oh my God, I'm so worried.",
3,5,Initiation,1432,Angela,I'm sure Dwight will protect him.,
3,5,Initiation,1432,Kelly,I don't know. Dwight's so weird.,
3,5,Initiation,1432,Angela,"He's not weird, he's just individualistic.",
3,5,Initiation,1432,Kelly,"No, he's a freak.",
3,5,Initiation,1432,Angela,You're a freak!,
3,5,Initiation,1433,Dwight,"Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?",
3,5,Initiation,1433,Ryan,"Um, loneliness. Maybe women.",
3,5,Initiation,1433,Dwight,"Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.",
3,5,Initiation,1433,Ryan,No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK.,
3,5,Initiation,1433,Dwight,Wrestle him to the ground.,
3,5,Initiation,1433,Ryan,"No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.",
3,5,Initiation,1433,Dwight,Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?,
3,5,Initiation,1433,Cousin Mose,"Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice.",
3,5,Initiation,1433,Dwight,Where are all the animals?,
3,5,Initiation,1434,Dwight,"Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.",
3,5,Initiation,1435,Dwight,"You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.",
3,5,Initiation,1435,Ryan,"Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.",
3,5,Initiation,1435,Dwight,Screwgun. The sales call!,
3,5,Initiation,1436,Kevin, Hey! Hey!,
3,5,Initiation,1436,Michael,"Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?",
3,5,Initiation,1437,Dwight,"Establish time frames. Keep the phrase ""real dollars"" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.",
3,5,Initiation,1437,Ryan,"Wait, can you go back?",
3,5,Initiation,1437,Dwight,"Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.",
3,5,Initiation,1438,Ryan,"Ok, I'm going to establish time frames.",
3,5,Initiation,1438,Dwight,Good.,
3,5,Initiation,1438,Ryan,"I'm going to put everything in terms of ""real dollars"".",
3,5,Initiation,1438,Dwight,Right.,
3,5,Initiation,1438,Ryan,I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.,
3,5,Initiation,1438,Dwight,Uh huh.,
3,5,Initiation,1438,Ryan,"Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.",
3,5,Initiation,1438,Dwight,Exactly. Yes.,
3,5,Initiation,1438,Ryan,"I'm going to try to be confident, but not cocky.",
3,5,Initiation,1439,Michael,"Oh! Hey! Everyone, I am officially streamlining the efficiency of this corporation. Second...",
3,5,Initiation,1439,Toby,Second?,
3,5,Initiation,1439,Michael,"Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.",
3,5,Initiation,1439,Kevin,"Account...? Michael, what is going on?",
3,5,Initiation,1439,Michael,And I will be taking questions.,
3,5,Initiation,1439,Pam,"Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?",
3,5,Initiation,1439,Phyllis,What's on your suit?,
3,5,Initiation,1439,Michael,"Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!",
3,5,Initiation,1440,Ryan,They really didn't like me.,
3,5,Initiation,1440,Dwight,They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.,
3,5,Initiation,1440,Ryan,I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.,
3,5,Initiation,1440,Dwight,"Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing?  Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.",
3,5,Initiation,1440,Ryan,You drive.,
3,5,Initiation,1441,Pam,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.",
3,5,Initiation,1442,Dwight," Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.",
3,5,Initiation,1442,Ryan,I think about that all the time.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Kevin,"Night, Pam.",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,Night.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Michael,"Hey, what time is it?",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,20 past 5.,

3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,PM.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Michael,"Oh, good.",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,These came for you. Contracts? Brent Koselli?,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Michael,Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,This is a huge sale.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Michael,Yes. Right. Good.,

3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,Hi.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,Hi.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,"Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing.",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,Oh.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,"And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,I had to work late. Jan's making me keep a log of everything Michael does all day.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,Wow. Do you think you could send me a copy of that?,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,"Yeah, totally. So...",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,So...,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,Do you...,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,"Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,"Uh, no, I um. Everything's pretty much the same here.",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,"Oh, good.",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,A little different. What time is it there?,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,"What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone.",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,"Oh, yeah. Right.",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,How far away did you think we were?,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,I don't know. It felt far.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,Yeah. I have a question for you.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,What?,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,How many words per minute does the average person type?,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,I type 90.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,Shut up. Mavis Beacon doesn't even type 90.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,It's true.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,"Ok, I said average.",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,70? How many do you type?,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,Come on. Tell me.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,No.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,You have to tell me now.,
3,5,Initiation,1443,Jim,"65. Ok, no need to laugh.",
3,5,Initiation,1443,Pam,"No, it's, that's respectable.",

3,5,Initiation,1444,Jim,Right.,

3,5,Initiation,1444,Pam,"And, I'm freaking out.",
3,5,Initiation,1444,Jim,Yeah.,
3,5,Initiation,1444,Pam,That movie is so scary!,
3,5,Initiation,1444,Jim,I know!,
3,5,Initiation,1444,Pam,But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.,
3,5,Initiation,1444,Jim,No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?,
3,5,Initiation,1444,Pam,Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.,
3,5,Initiation,1444,Jim,"No, you're making this up!",
3,5,Initiation,1444,Pam,Would I make that up?,
3,5,Initiation,1444,Jim,"Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.",
3,5,Initiation,1444,Pam,"Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.",
3,5,Initiation,1444,Jim,And how many kitchens?,

3,5,Initiation,1444,Jim,Most apartments these days have like three.,
3,5,Initiation,1444,Pam,Three kitchens?,
3,5,Initiation,1444,Jim,Yes! How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?,

3,6,Diwali,1446,Michael, OK.,
3,6,Diwali,1447,Michael,"Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it  it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great.  Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.",
3,6,Diwali,1448,Kelly,You look so handsome.,

3,6,Diwali,1451,Angela,Don't go. They eat monkey brains.,
3,6,Diwali,1451,Michael,Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.,

I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills.

3,6,Diwali,1481,Michael,"Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.",

3,6,Diwali,1486,Pam,Yeah.,
3,6,Diwali,1486,Michael,Yeah. Uuuuh... well.,
3,6,Diwali,1486,Pam,I kind of thought something would happen tonight too.,

3,6,Diwali,1486,Pam,...kiss.,
3,6,Diwali,1486,Michael, Can I have a ride home?,
3,6,Diwali,1486,Pam,If you sit in the back.,
3,6,Diwali,1487,Karen,"Goodnight, guys.",
3,6,Diwali,1487,Jim,"Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.",
3,6,Diwali,1487,Andy,"No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin.",

3,6,Diwali,1489,Michael,Sorry.,
3,6,Diwali,1490,Michael,"This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler.  Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!",

3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Jan,I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Michael,I don't understand.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Jan,The board voted last night to close your branch.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Michael,On whom's authority?,
3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Jan,The board's.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Michael,What?,
3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Jan,"I'm very sorry. I don't relish telling you this. You've been a big part of this company, and the board asked me to thank you for your years of service.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Michael,You're welcome.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Jan,"A small number of people will be transferred to the Stamford branch, and the rest will be getting severance packages.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Michael,Am I a small number person or a severance package person?,

3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Jan,It's... it's about talent.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Michael,"Oh, you gotta be... Josh?",
3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Jan,Our CFO believes that Josh is going to play an important role in our company's future.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1494,Michael,"Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?",
3,7,Branch Closing,1495,Michael,"It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1496,Michael,Pictures. Memories.  Look at that. They grow up so fast.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1497,Dwight,Hey stranger.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1497,Michael,Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1497,Dwight,Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1497,Michael,"Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1498,Dwight ,"When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, ""Something Weird is Going On."" Colon, ""What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.""",
3,7,Branch Closing,1499,Karen,"Hey, um... did you hear about your friends in Pennsylvania? Rumor has it that the Scranton Branch is... ",

3,7,Branch Closing,1500,Pam,What can't you tell me?,
3,7,Branch Closing,1500,Michael,"Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make? We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1500,Pam,What?!,
3,7,Branch Closing,1500,Michael,What?,
3,7,Branch Closing,1500,Pam,You just said that we're gonna be gone...?,
3,7,Branch Closing,1500,Michael,Do I have any messages?,

3,7,Branch Closing,1501,Michael,"You knew about this all along, didn't you?",
3,7,Branch Closing,1501,Toby,Jan told me just a few minutes before she told you.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1501,Michael,Traitor. You are a traitor.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1501,Angela,"What about us, Michael? Do we still have jobs?",
3,7,Branch Closing,1501,Michael,I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1502,Ryan,It makes perfect sense that it would happen today because I just received this in the mail.  A thousand business cards with this address and phone number.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1503,Angela,I don't want to blame anyone in particular. I think everyone's to blame.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1504,Kelly,"If I get to stay and Ryan is laid off, I will kill myself. Like Romeo and Juliet, the Claire Danes one.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1505,Andy," Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!",
3,7,Branch Closing,1506,Jim,"I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1507,Stanley,I couldn't be happier. I'm gonna take the severance and retire. My wife and I are gonna travel.  I really couldn't be happier.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1508,Pam,"It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, ""Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam."" So, maybe that'll stop now.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1509,Roy,What does that mean?,
3,7,Branch Closing,1509,Kevin,"Well, some of us are fired and a few are going to Connecticut.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1510,Roy,"I don't really want to work here without Pam. You know that Cinderella song, ""You Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)""? That pretty much says it better than how I know how to say it... in words.",

3,7,Branch Closing,1511,Michael,Darryl. Noble Darryl. ,
3,7,Branch Closing,1511,Darryl,"Look, I heard about the office. Tough break.",

3,7,Branch Closing,1511,Darryl,I wasn't.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1511,Michael,"So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...",
3,7,Branch Closing,1511,Darryl,"Actually, Bob Vance bought out the warehouse. So he's keeping on the whole crew. So, we good.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1511,Michael,Awesome.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1512,Michael,This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1513,Michael,"All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there.  Let's go.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1513,Dwight,Yes!,
3,7,Branch Closing,1513,Pam,"Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1513,Michael,Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1514,Dwight,What's the plan?,

3,7,Branch Closing,1515,Dwight,"But, do not worry. I have his home address right  here.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1515,Michael,Why?,
3,7,Branch Closing,1515,Dwight,Christmas card list.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1515,Michael,You sent him cards? You never met him.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1515,Dwight,"But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1516,Jim,"Hey, do you have a second?",
3,7,Branch Closing,1516,Josh,"Sure, what's up?",
3,7,Branch Closing,1516,Jim,"I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?",
3,7,Branch Closing,1516,Josh,I honestly don't. I don't know.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1516,Jim,"Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?",
3,7,Branch Closing,1516,Josh,"You know what, Jim, I wouldn't worry about it.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1516,Jim,What does that mean?,
3,7,Branch Closing,1517,Jan,Hi.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1517,Josh,"Jan, hey.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1517,Jan,"Oh, good. You're both here. Ready to talk logistics?",
3,7,Branch Closing,1518,Ryan," I just feel like it could have been something special if we could have kept working together, but I'm gonna go someplace else and you're gonna go someplace else. It just doesn't make sense.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1519,Ryan,"This kinda worked out perfectly for me. I got some good experience. Uh, Michael's gonna write me a great recommendation. And as far as me and Kelly goes, I think it's for the best.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1520,Michael,"Okay, this is it.  This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like ""Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person."" It's very dramatic. Although, I can't say I was a big fan of 'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1521,Jan,"So, Josh will be running what is now called Dunder-Mifflin ,Northeast, which is all the offices north of Stamford. And Jim, fi you want the job, you'll be his number two.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1521,Josh,"Wow. Uh, sure. Absolutely.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1521,Jan,Awesome.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1521,Josh,"Excuse me, Jan, I'm sorry... I'm gonna have to stop you there. I, um, will not be taking the job.",

3,7,Branch Closing,1522,Michael,I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.,

3,7,Branch Closing,1522,Michael ,Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?,
3,7,Branch Closing,1522,Dwight,"Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1522,Michael,"Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1522,Dwight,"Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1522,Michael," Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1522,Dwight," Whoa hey, why not?",

3,7,Branch Closing,1523,Jan,Yeah.,

3,7,Branch Closing,1526,Phyllis,We know the branch is closing, Michael told us.
3,7,Branch Closing,1526,Jan,"Ah, god. Okay. You know what everybody? I'm sure there is a better way to do this but I've drive something like 400 miles today and I'm completely exhausted so I'm just gonna tell you. Your branch is not closing; Stamford is closing.

3,7,Branch Closing,1531,Pam,I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1531,Ryan,Is Jim coming back.,
3,7,Branch Closing,1531,Pam,"That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1531,Ryan,"I just don't want it to be weird, you know? I mean, I took his old job and his old desk.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1531,Pam,"Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?",
3,7,Branch Closing,1531,Ryan,"Oh, yeah, totally.",

3,7,Branch Closing,1536,Pam,"Yeah, me too.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1537,Pam,"Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.",
3,7,Branch Closing,1538,Jim,"Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.",

3,7,Branch Closing,1540,Michael,"Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!",
3,7,Branch Closing,1540,Dwight, Oh my God!,
3,7,Branch Closing,1540,Michael,What?!,
3,7,Branch Closing,1540,Dwight:,"Stranford is closed! Michael, we're not closed. Stamford is closed. Stamford is closed.",

3,8,The Merger,1542,Jim,The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.,

3,8,The Merger,1543,Jim,Yeah.,

3,8,The Merger,1544,Toby,About seven.,
3,8,The Merger,1544,Dwight, I could beat that on a skateboard.,
3,8,The Merger,1544,Toby,"Well, that has wheels.",

3,8,The Merger,1544,Pam,"Really, Dwight? How fast are you?",
3,8,The Merger,1544,Dwight,Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.,
3,8,The Merger,1544,Pam,Really?,
3,8,The Merger,1545,Dwight,I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.,
3,8,The Merger,1546,Dwight,"Man, what is taking Toby so long?",
3,8,The Merger,1546,Pam,"Oh, I'll just time him later.",

3,8,The Merger,1546,Dwight,I can't... ,
3,8,The Merger,1546,Pam,"Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company.  Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.",
3,8,The Merger,1546,Dwight,Aaaaah!,

3,8,The Merger,1547,Michael,Okay.,
3,8,The Merger,1548,Michael,"My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. ",

3,8,The Merger,1550,Dwight,The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.,

3,8,The Merger,1551,Michael,"Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.",

3,8,The Merger,1568,Michael,Not now.,
3,8,The Merger,1568,Dwight,Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?,
3,8,The Merger,1568,Michael,I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.,
3,8,The Merger,1568,Dwight,Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?,
3,8,The Merger,1568,Michael,"It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.",
3,8,The Merger,1568,Dwight,Ok. Who reports to who?,
3,8,The Merger,1568,Michael,"I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?",
3,8,The Merger,1568,Dwight,And then if I want...,
3,8,The Merger,1568,Michael,Work it out amongst your selves!,
3,8,The Merger,1568,Dwight,I...,
3,8,The Merger,1568,Michael,"Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?",
3,8,The Merger,1568,Dwight,I...,
3,8,The Merger,1568,Michael,Will you?,
3,8,The Merger,1568,Dwight,One...,
3,8,The Merger,1568,Michael,Please?,

3,8,The Merger,1569,Kelly,Oh! Oh my god! I have so much to tell you!,
3,8,The Merger,1569,Jim,Really?,
3,8,The Merger,1569,Kelly,"Yes! Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? They had a baby and they named it Suri. And then Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They had a baby, too, and they named it Shiloh. And both babies are amazing!",
3,8,The Merger,1569,Jim,Great. What's new with you?,
3,8,The Merger,1569,Kelly,I just told you.,
3,8,The Merger,1570,Michael,"Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please , the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!",
3,8,The Merger,1571,Michael,Yoko shack.,
3,8,The Merger,1571,Male voice,...thank you James. ,

3,8,The Merger,1571,Michael,"Nope, no. Guests only.",
3,8,The Merger,1571,Kelly,Looks like salmon.,
3,8,The Merger,1571,Michael,"Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.",
3,8,The Merger,1571,Kelly,I eat beef.,
3,8,The Merger,1571,Michael,"Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.",
3,8,The Merger,1571,Kevin,The beef is poisoned?,
3,8,The Merger,1571,Michael,"No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please.  Welcome. Help yourself.",
3,8,The Merger,1571,Toby,Um... You might want these orientation materials.,
3,8,The Merger,1571,Michael,"Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.",
3,8,The Merger,1571,Jim,"Oh, this looks promising.",
3,8,The Merger,1571,Pam,You won't be disappointed.,
3,8,The Merger,1571,Michael,"Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch ""Lazy Scranton"".",
3,8,The Merger,1572,Michael,"Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.",
3,8,The Merger,1572,Dwight,"Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.",
3,8,The Merger,1572,Michael,So check out how we live,
3,8,The Merger,1572,Michael & Dwight,in the Electric City!,
3,8,The Merger,1572,Michael,They call it Scranton.,
3,8,The Merger,1572,Dwight,What?,
3,8,The Merger,1572,Michael,The Electric City. Scranton.,
3,8,The Merger,1572,Dwight,What?,
3,8,The Merger,1572,Michael,The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.,
3,8,The Merger,1572,Dwight,But check that it's covered by your health care provider!,
3,8,The Merger,1573,Jim,It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.,
3,8,The Merger,1574,Michael, I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.,
3,8,The Merger,1575,Michael,"You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,",
3,8,The Merger,1575,Dwight,But the little cars go in the compact spot,
3,8,The Merger,1575,Michael and Dwight,"Spot, spot, spot, spot ...",
3,8,The Merger,1576,Michael, Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?,
3,8,The Merger,1576,Michael,"Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.",
3,8,The Merger,1577,Karen, This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.,
3,8,The Merger,1577,Jim,Terrible. Totally unconvincing.,
3,8,The Merger,1577,Karen, This is Karen Filippelli. Please leave a message.,
3,8,The Merger,1577,Jim,"Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.",
3,8,The Merger,1577,Karen,  Dis is Kar-en Fill-uh-pel-li. Please leava me da message. A bon danza.,

3,8,The Merger,1577,Karen, Karen Filippelli.,
3,8,The Merger,1578,Andy,"Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?",
3,8,The Merger,1578,Dwight,Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.,
3,8,The Merger,1578,Andy,"Sure thing, buddy.",
3,8,The Merger,1579,Andy,"Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.",
3,8,The Merger,1580,Andy,"Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.",
3,8,The Merger,1580,Angela,Oh.,
3,8,The Merger,1580,Andy,Do you like it?,
3,8,The Merger,1580,Angela,"I do like it, actually.",
3,8,The Merger,1580,Andy,Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.,
3,8,The Merger,1580,Angela,Thank you.,
3,8,The Merger,1580,Andy,You're welcome.,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Pam,Hey.,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Jim,Hey!,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Pam,What happened to grape soda?,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Jim,Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Pam,Oh. You've changed so much.,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Jim,"Well, I'm evolving, Pam.",
3,8,The Merger,1581,Pam,So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Jim,"Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.",
3,8,The Merger,1581,Pam,"Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.",
3,8,The Merger,1581,Jim,Okay.,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Michael,Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Jim,Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Michael,All right.,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Jim,Don't...,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Michael,Okay.,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Jim,All right.  I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.,
3,8,The Merger,1581,Pam,"Yeah. I know, me too.",
3,8,The Merger,1581,Jim,All right!,
3,8,The Merger,1582,Pam,"The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.",
3,8,The Merger,1583,Hannah, Take a picture. It'll last longer.,
3,8,The Merger,1583,Ryan,"I'm sorry. It's just, it's a little distracting.",
3,8,The Merger,1583,Creed,"Ditto that, my brother.",
3,8,The Merger,1584,Hannah,Look what's on his computer.,
3,8,The Merger,1584,Michael,What is that? A squid's eye or...,
3,8,The Merger,1584,Hannah,It's my left breast.,
3,8,The Merger,1584,Michael,How did you...,
3,8,The Merger,1584,Creed,Right place at the right time.,
3,8,The Merger,1585,Karen,"Uh, what's that smell?",
3,8,The Merger,1585,Phyllis,What smell?,
3,8,The Merger,1585,Karen,Must be an... air freshener plugged in somewhere. It smells like a funeral home.,
3,8,The Merger,1585,Phyllis,"Oh, I'll help you find it.",
3,8,The Merger,1585,Karen,"Oh, you know. Never... .never mind.",
3,8,The Merger,1585,Phyllis,What is it?,
3,8,The Merger,1585,Karen,"I... I... I, uh, think I'm just allergic to your perfume.",
3,8,The Merger,1585,Phyllis,My perfume?,
3,8,The Merger,1585,Karen,"It's just my crazy nose. I'm... uh, used to different smells.",
3,8,The Merger,1585,Phyllis,Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.,
3,8,The Merger,1585,Karen,Who's Bob Vance?,
3,8,The Merger,1585,Phyllis,"You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.",
3,8,The Merger,1586,Stanley,I don't know who these new people think they are. I've sat downwind of Phyllis' stinky perfumes for years. Never said a word.,
3,8,The Merger,1587,Michael,People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael,"I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.",
3,8,The Merger,1588,Dwight,Do you have batteries?,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael,Ssshh stupid! Um...,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael,That's it!,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Andy, What is love?,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael,"Yes, yes! Okay!",
3,8,The Merger,1588,Andy,"Baby, don't hurt me.",
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael,"Okay, here we go.",
3,8,The Merger,1588,Andy & Michael,"Don't hurt me! Baby, don't hurt me!",
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael,Oh!,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Andy,"Baby, don't hurt me!",
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael,Oh! Oh! Oh!,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Andy,Whoa-oh-oh-oh,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael,Scuse me! Scuse me!,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Andy & Michael,Whoa-oh-oh-oh! Whoa-oh-oh...,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael,You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Andy,Whoa-oh-oh-oh.,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael,"You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!",
3,8,The Merger,1588,Andy,"Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.",
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael," Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.",
3,8,The Merger,1588,Dwight,"Very funny, Michael!",
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael,Okay! Okay!,
3,8,The Merger,1588,Dwight,"Really funny, Michael!",
3,8,The Merger,1588,Michael,"All right, all right, I'm on a roll.",
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Karen,Shouldn't we be equals?,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,"Uh... this is difficult, for me.",
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,I understand. We're all friends.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,No. I mean I can't physically. I can't get on the table.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,"Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.",
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,You know what? I'll help. I will...,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,"No, please. No.",
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Dwight,Do this. Come on. Ready?,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Dwight,On three. One... two... three.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,"Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.",
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,All right. All right. Stop. Put me down.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,Let me go!,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,I'm right in your crack!,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,Put me down right...,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,Up and over.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,Put me down!,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,Up and over.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,Put me down right now!,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,You've got it.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,I'VE HAD ENOUGH!,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,"You've got it, you've got it.",
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW or else!,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Dwight,"Hey, hey. Easy.",
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,Easy.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,I'm sorry!,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,Don't...,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,It's just not going to work for me.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,What...,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,I have to go.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,I don't understand.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,I was on the fence about this and... it's just not a good fit.,
3,8,The Merger,1589,Michael,"Well, we'll squeeze you in.",
3,8,The Merger,1589,Tony,I can't work here. I have to quit.,
3,8,The Merger,1590,Michael,"You can't quit! On the first day. That's  heresy, my friend!  Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?",
3,8,The Merger,1590,Tony,No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style.,
3,8,The Merger,1590,Michael,My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?,
3,8,The Merger,1590,Tony,No. Was it supposed to be funny?,
3,8,The Merger,1590,Michael,"Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.",
3,8,The Merger,1590,Tony,Excuse me?,
3,8,The Merger,1590,Michael,"You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!",
3,8,The Merger,1590,Tony,But there's nothing in my desk except coupons.,
3,8,The Merger,1590,Michael,"Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.",
3,8,The Merger,1590,Dwight,That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.,
3,8,The Merger,1590,Michael,"Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.",
3,8,The Merger,1590,Dwight,And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice?  Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.,
3,8,The Merger,1591,Andy,Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.,
3,8,The Merger,1592,Hannah,Tony was right. This environment is dysfunctional.,
3,8,The Merger,1592,Angela,Maybe that's because some people treat it like their own private Hooters strip club.,
3,8,The Merger,1592,Michael,"Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.",
3,8,The Merger,1592,Stanley,Back to work. We don't have to get along. We just have to work together.,
3,8,The Merger,1592,Michael,No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.,
3,8,The Merger,1593,Michael,"The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.",
3,8,The Merger,1594,Michael,"Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.",
3,8,The Merger,1594,Dwight,What!,
3,8,The Merger,1594,Michael,Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!,
3,8,The Merger,1594,Karen,Does Bob Vance work for Vance Refrigeration?,
3,8,The Merger,1594,Jim,Does he ever.,
3,8,The Merger,1595,Michael,"Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.",
3,8,The Merger,1595,Dwight,YEAH!,
3,8,The Merger,1595,Michael,Yeah.,
3,8,The Merger,1595,Toby,I don't... I don't think we can do that.,
3,8,The Merger,1595,Michael,"Go home, Toby. Just...",
3,8,The Merger,1595,Martin,Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire?,
3,8,The Merger,1595,Michael,"Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful.  ""You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!""",
3,8,The Merger,1595,Hannah,For crying out loud.,
3,8,The Merger,1595,Michael,"No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...",
3,8,The Merger,1595,Martin, What's up with this guy?,
3,8,The Merger,1595,Stanley,Got an hour? I'll try to explain.,
3,8,The Merger,1595,Michael,THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!,
3,8,The Merger,1596,Stanley,Trust me. It only gets worse.,
3,8,The Merger,1596,Martin,Is he always like this?,
3,8,The Merger,1596,Ryan,Sometimes he brings more costumes.,
3,8,The Merger,1596,Hannah,When do people work?,
3,8,The Merger,1596,Phyllis,"Oh, we find little times during the day.",
3,8,The Merger,1596,Karen,How are we going to get home?,
3,8,The Merger,1596,Phyllis,Bob Vance has an air pump. He said he'd fill all our tires up.,
3,8,The Merger,1596,Karen,Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration.,
3,8,The Merger,1597,Michael,"See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most.  Jell-o!",
3,8,The Merger,1597,Jan,Michael!,
3,8,The Merger,1597,Michael,"Hi, Jan!",
3,8,The Merger,1597,Jan,Did you fire Tony Gardner when he was trying to quit?,
3,8,The Merger,1597,Michael,I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.,
3,8,The Merger,1597,Jan,"Do you realize, Michael, that we now have to pay him severance?",
3,8,The Merger,1597,Michael,Yes.,
3,8,The Merger,1597,Jan,You do?,
3,8,The Merger,1597,Michael,But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.,
3,8,The Merger,1597,Jan,"What? No. No. No, Jim is your Number Two.",
3,8,The Merger,1597,Michael,What?,
3,8,The Merger,1597,Jan,He's the only one who has worked with both groups. I sent you a memo about this.,
3,8,The Merger,1597,Michael,"Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.",
3,8,The Merger,1598,Michael,"So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.",
3,8,The Merger,1598,Dwight,If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.,
3,8,The Merger,1598,Jim,"Yeah, it does, actually.",
3,8,The Merger,1598,Dwight,So who will be your new Number Three?,
3,8,The Merger,1598,Michael,Uh... that I have not decided yet.,
3,8,The Merger,1598,Andy,"Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.",
3,8,The Merger,1598,Michael,"Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.",
3,8,The Merger,1598,Dwight,And I have to say your leadership...,
3,8,The Merger,1598,Michael,Shut it...,
3,8,The Merger,1598,Dwight,has brought...,
3,8,The Merger,1598,Michael,Shut it! That's...  suck up!,
3,8,The Merger,1599,Jim," Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?",
3,8,The Merger,1599,Karen, I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.,
3,8,The Merger,1599,Jim, What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?,
3,8,The Merger,1599,Karen,Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.,

3,8,The Merger,1600,Pam,What do you mean?,
3,8,The Merger,1600,Jim,I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...,
3,8,The Merger,1600,Pam,Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.,
3,8,The Merger,1600,Jim,O..ok. Um..good.,

3,8,The Merger,1601,Meredith,Where'd you get that salad?,
3,8,The Merger,1601,Kevin,Staples.,
3,8,The Merger,1602,Andy,"Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?",
3,8,The Merger,1602,Dwight,"Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.",
3,8,The Merger,1602,Andy,"Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.",
3,8,The Merger,1602,Dwight,Xterra's not even a real word.,
3,8,The Merger,1602,Andy,"Actually, it is. It's Latin for ""earth.""",
3,8,The Merger,1602,Dwight,"Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?",
3,8,The Merger,1602,Andy,Yeah.,
3,8,The Merger,1602,Dwight,That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.,
3,8,The Merger,1602,Andy,"Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.",
3,8,The Merger,1602,Dwight,Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.,
3,8,The Merger,1602,Andy,"Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.",
3,8,The Merger,1602,Dwight,"Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.",
3,8,The Merger,1602,Andy,"Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.",
3,8,The Merger,1602,Dwight,Idiot!,
3,8,The Merger,1602,Andy,"If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.",

3,8,The Merger,1602,Andy, Idiot!,
3,8,The Merger,1602,Dwight, You're the idiot!,
3,8,The Merger,1602,Andy, Nice comeback!,

3,9,The Convict,1604,Jim,Just about... yup. Now.,
3,9,The Convict,1605,Jim,"Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.",
3,9,The Convict,1606,Michael,"Yeah, Jan, it um... looks like a check, piece of paper of some sort. Receipt. I don't know.",
3,9,The Convict,1606,Angela,"Jan, this is Angela Martin from accounting.",
3,9,The Convict,1606,Jan, Mmhmm.,
3,9,The Convict,1606,Angela,"Look, we have a rebate from... the Federal Work Opportunity Program and no one knows what that means.",
3,9,The Convict,1606,Jan,We get that money for hiring an ex-convict.,
3,9,The Convict,1606,Michael,I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.  ... I'm just kidding.,
3,9,The Convict,1606,Jan,When did the check come?,
3,9,The Convict,1606,Angela,Last week.,
3,9,The Convict,1606,Jan,"Okay, that's when the branches merged, so Josh must have been taking advantage of this program. Smart move.",
3,9,The Convict,1606,Angela,One of the Stamford people is a criminal?,
3,9,The Convict,1606,Michael,"Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.",
3,9,The Convict,1606,Angela,"Jan, which one of the new employees is a criminal?",
3,9,The Convict,1606,Jan,"Uh, reformed convict, and, uh, I'm not sure. Though hang on, let me email our HR, stay on the line.",
3,9,The Convict,1606,Pam, Who is it?,

3,9,The Convict,1606,Michael,Kuhhhh... you are such a racist.,
3,9,The Convict,1606,Kevin,"Wait, why am I a racist?",
3,9,The Convict,1606,Michael,Because you think he's black.,
3,9,The Convict,1606,Kevin,He is black... right? And...,
3,9,The Convict,1606,Michael,Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.,
3,9,The Convict,1606,Jan,...Okay it's someone named Martin Nash.,
3,9,The Convict,1606,Kevin,Yeah!,
3,9,The Convict,1606,Jan,Michael?,
3,9,The Convict,1607,Michael,Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.,
3,9,The Convict,1608,Kevin,I wonder what he did.,
3,9,The Convict,1608,Michael,"In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.",
3,9,The Convict,1608,Pam,Why would anyone go to jail for that?,
3,9,The Convict,1608,Michael,"Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.",
3,9,The Convict,1608,Kevin,Cool.,
3,9,The Convict,1608,Pam,Okay. Angela?,
3,9,The Convict,1608,Angela,"Sure. Let's protect the convicts. At the expense of the general feeling of safety in the workplace. As a 90-pound female that sits in an ill-lit, rarely-visited corner of the office, naturally I agree with that.",
3,9,The Convict,1608,Michael,Good. All right. ,
3,9,The Convict,1609,Jim, Jim Halpert.,

3,9,The Convict,1609,Andy,"Oh, and I care why?",
3,9,The Convict,1609,Jim,She's... high-maintenance.,
3,9,The Convict,1609,Andy,"Next. How about... . Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that.",
3,9,The Convict,1609,Jim,"Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.",
3,9,The Convict,1609,Andy,"Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?",

3,9,The Convict,1611,Dwight,"I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.",
3,9,The Convict,1612,Andy,"All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?",
3,9,The Convict,1613,Jim,"I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...",
3,9,The Convict,1614,Jim,Frisbee-based competitions...,
3,9,The Convict,1614,Andy,Are you kidding?,
3,9,The Convict,1614,Jim,She...,
3,9,The Convict,1614,Andy,I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.,
3,9,The Convict,1614,Jim,"Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy.  Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?",
3,9,The Convict,1615,Michael,"Hey Martin, how's it going?",
3,9,The Convict,1615,Martin,"Good. Getting settled, you know?",
3,9,The Convict,1615,Michael,"Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.",
3,9,The Convict,1615,Pam,My dad.,

3,9,The Convict,1615,Michael,Apollo Creed.,
3,9,The Convict,1616,Michael,"Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.",
3,9,The Convict,1617,Martin,So... you all wanna know what I was in for?,
3,9,The Convict,1617,Michael,No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.,
3,9,The Convict,1617,Martin,"Um, I really don't mind. It was a stupid mistake. I was working in finance and, I... got involved in some insider trading. So, I spent a little time in the clink.",
3,9,The Convict,1617,Michael, That is awesome.,
3,9,The Convict,1618,Kevin,"I had Martin explain to me three times what he got arrested for, because... it sounds an awful lot like what I do here every day.",
3,9,The Convict,1619,Pam,What was prison like?,
3,9,The Convict,1619,Martin,Not terrible. Boring. We do the same thing every day. But... at least we got outdoors time.,
3,9,The Convict,1619,Kevin,You got outdoors time?,
3,9,The Convict,1619,Martin,"Two hours, every day. Sometimes we'd play pickup football games...",
3,9,The Convict,1619,Kevin,"Michael, why don't we get outdoors time?",

3,9,The Convict,1619,Michael,"Well, we are running a business, so.",
3,9,The Convict,1619,Meredith,What was your cell like?,
3,9,The Convict,1619,Martin,"Not good. Uh... a little bit bigger than Michael's office... but, you know, I really only slept there. You know, during the day, there-our time's our own. They had uh, classes, I took some... watercolor classes.",
3,9,The Convict,1619,Pam,They have art classes?,
3,9,The Convict,1619,Martin,Yeap. Yeah.,
3,9,The Convict,1619,Ryan,They have business classes there?,
3,9,The Convict,1619,Martin,"They did, taught by some uh, Harvard business school guys--a lot of the guys also, that were in the class, the inmates, a lot of them have gone on to do extraordinary things in business.",
3,9,The Convict,1619,Pam,Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.,
3,9,The Convict,1619,Michael,Ah. Well. That's not true.,
3,9,The Convict,1619,Kevin,I would so rather be in prison.,
3,9,The Convict,1619,Ryan,Prison sounds great.,

3,9,The Convict,1622,Andy,"Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So...

Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?",
3,9,The Convict,1622,Pam,Wow... I--,
3,9,The Convict,1622,Andy,Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back.,
3,9,The Convict,1623,Pam,Wow. That was... wow.,
3,9,The Convict,1624,Michael,"Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go!",
3,9,The Convict,1625,Pam,"Michael, it's freezing out.",
3,9,The Convict,1625,Phyllis,I can't feel my toes.,

3,9,The Convict,1626,Martin,"Actually, our TV was bigger than that one.",
3,9,The Convict,1627,Michael,These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.,
3,9,The Convict,1628,Jim,Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.,
3,9,The Convict,1628,Andy,Yeah.,
3,9,The Convict,1628,Jim,Quick question - do you play the guitar?,
3,9,The Convict,1628,Andy,I play the banjo.,

3,9,The Convict,1629,Michael,"All right everybody, there has been a lot of name calling against our office today. Corporate maligning, slurring, much of it coming from one of you, who claims that prison is better... than... here. And none of can say ""Boo"" because none of us have ever been to prison. Well, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Somebody else who has been to prison, who can tell you what it is really like . I'm prison Mike! You know why they call me prison Mike?!",

3,9,The Convict,1629,Jim,"So, not prison.",
3,9,The Convict,1629,Michael,"And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.",
3,9,The Convict,1629,Jim,"What'd you do, Prison Mike?",
3,9,The Convict,1629,Michael,I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.,

3,9,The Convict,1629,Angela,"Don't encourage him, Dwight.",
3,9,The Convict,1629,Michael,"The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!",
3,9,The Convict,1629,Karen,Demen-Dementors like in Harry Potter?,
3,9,The Convict,1629,Michael,"No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?",

3,9,The Convict,1629,Martin,"Yeah, that... wasn't really... at all my experience. There were certain elements of what you performed, I've seen on television. But it didn't remind me of my time in prison.",

3,9,The Convict,1629,Jim,"Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.",
3,9,The Convict,1629,Michael,"No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas.",

3,9,The Convict,1632,Michael,"Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.",
3,9,The Convict,1632,Toby,"You know they're teasing you. I mean... obviously, this is... a much nicer place than an actual prison. We get paid to be here. We go home afterwards and have social lives. We have... we have parties here. They're teasing you. To be funny.",
3,9,The Convict,1632,Michael," Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!",

3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Dwight,"Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.",
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Pam,"Dwight, what uh...",
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Dwight,I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Pam,"Well, get it out of here.",
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Dwight,"Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?",
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Jim,Merry Christmas Dwight.,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Dwight,Jim.,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Jim,Wow. What have we got here?,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Dwight,What does it look like?,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Jim,Dead goose.,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Dwight,And circle gets the square.,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Jim,All right.,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Dwight, So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Toby,"Oh, Dwight, we talked about this.",
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1635,Dwight,"No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.",
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1636,Dwight,"Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.",
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Dwight,"He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.",
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Jim,Wow. Win-Win.,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Dwight,"Exactly. Thank you, Jim.",
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Phyllis,I like goose. If it's already dead is it so crazy we eat it?,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Creed,That's crazy. It's crazy.,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Toby,"Dwight, you cannot keep that here.",
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Dwight,"Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.",
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Toby,"Come on Dwight. We went over this, like for a half an hour.",
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Dwight,It's Christmas Toby.,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Toby,It's a dead animal in an office. You can't...,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Dwight,Toby...,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Toby,I'm sorry.,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Dwight, Please? Please?,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Toby,Clean it in your car.,
3,10,A Benihana Christmas (Parts 1&2),1637,Pam,I would like it off my desk.,
